Notes from Greenblatt's book

<p>Page 98:
<blockquote>
As a general rule, even if institutional investors are attracted to a parent company because an undesirable business is being spun off, they will wait until after the spinoff is completed before buying stock in the parent.This practice relieves the institution from having to sell the stock of the unwanted spinoff and removes the risk of the spinoff not being completed. Often institutional buying of the parent's stock after the spinoff has a tendency to drive up the price. That's why, if the parent company appears to be an attractive investment, it is usally worthwhile to buy stock before the spinoff takes place.
