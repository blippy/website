<hr><h2>Hollanders article</h2>

From an <a href="http://www.beinvestors.com/value-traps-how-to-recognize-and-avoid-them/">article</a> dated 05-Jul-2011.

Here are some tips to recognize a value trap:

<li>Avoid shares involved in fraud or that have inaccuracies in the accounts
<li>Be careful of companies with an overly optimistic management
<li>Be careful with companies in highly regulated industries
<li>Avoid stocks that have reduced, or eliminated, their dividend
<li>Avoid stocks with high debt
<li>Be careful of companies in a highly competitive sector
<li>Avoid stocks that have dropped in price due to outdated products or services
<li>Only look at companies that make a profit
<li>Be careful with cyclical companies, their appreciation seems the cheapest when they are the most expensive and visa versa.
<li>Look at the behavior of insiders, are they buying or selling?
<li>Despite the fall in price, is the underlying strategy of the company is still intact?
