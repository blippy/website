high and momentum investing (PDF)</a> - the 52-week high price
explains a large portion of the profits from momentum investing -
results indicate that the 52-week measure has predictive power whether
or not individual stocks have had extreme past returns. This suggests
that price level is important, and is consistent with an
anchor-and-adjust bias. After controlling for the size effect and the
impact of bid-ask bounce, returns associated with winners and losers
identified by the 52-week high strategy are about twice as large as
those associated with the other strategies.
