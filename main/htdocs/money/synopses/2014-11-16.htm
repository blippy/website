<b>Title: Cut and thrust - Dividend cuts may reflect past mistakes but also future growth potential - The Value Perspective - Schroders</b>

<p>



<ol>
<li>Rebasing dividends to a more 'normal level means that, once a business has passed through its troubled period, its future pay-outs have greater potential for growth, even if profits take a prolonged period to return to their 'pre-trouble' levels.

<li>'cutters' enjoying stronger dividend growth than the rest of the market over the next five years.

<li>the low market expectations that follow dividend cuts would have allowed you to buy into some of the biggest companies in the UK at depressed prices and benefit from some very attractive growth indeed - both in terms of income and capital returns.

<li>Thus, for example, after packaging giant DS Smith halved its pay-out in 2009, it went on to grow its dividend by at least 15% in each of the next five years - and 230% in all - while its share price rose 952% over the period. 

<li>Do not therefore think of dividend cuts as merely reflective of past mistakes - they can also highlight a significant opportunity.
