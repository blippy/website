<b>Title: Shorting, Lonmin</b>

<p>From ADVFN Redde thread (<a href="http://uk.advfn.com/cmn/fbb/thread.php3?id=31996003&from=1605#firstpost">xlink</a>):
<blockquote>
  Very dangerous shorting stocks in an up-trend particularly on the pull back to or below the trend line. Investor sentiment is usually driven to buy the drop even if it ultimately results in a lower high and reversal of the trend.

<p>If you're going to short then you must do it on a reversal signal at the next high in the up-trend. And no Technical Analyst worth his salt would suggest you do this, it's like timing buying the lows for reversals on a downtrend, very high risk.

<p>Always wait for the consolidation phase and buy the pullback on the first breakout, provided it's a higher low. aimho

<p>From ADVFN Lonmin thread (<a href="http://uk.advfn.com/cmn/fbb/thread.php3?id=12397493&from=7869#firstpost">xlink</a>):
<blockquote>
  Morgan Stanley's UK equity strategist Graham Secker and his team looked at the 115 largest rights issues in the UK over the past 15 years, and they concluded the best long-term performers are companies that:
<ul>
  <li>raise a large amount relative to their market value
<li>have performed poorly in the prior year
<li>use the cash to repair/strengthen balance sheets
    </ul>

<p>It is worth noting that companies that have been performing well and are raising relatively small sums of cash to fund acquisitions or capital expenditure programs tend to underperform in the long run.
