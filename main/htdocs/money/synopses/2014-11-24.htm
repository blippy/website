CockneyRebel on AIM/QPP share selection 
</b>

<p>
Years ago you couldn't list on AIM unless you had 2-3 years history of profit. Today you can bash together a floatation on AIM with little history.

If you remove every foreign based AIM co off your investment list then you have cleared 70% of the likely filth that are here just to scam investors imo.

Next you ignore loss making AIM stocks and new flotations on AIM. That gets rid of another 20% of the AIM stocks.

That leaves you with 10% of the companies on AIM to look at as investable. The prime ones here will be those that have been on AIM 5 yrs or more and have a history of growing profits and paying a divi. Those that pay a divi and have done so for 5 years are likely to be far more reliable than the rest. That's where you make money on AIM - not in crap like QPP imo.

<p>Zulu stocks are the ones where you make money on AIM imo - they will be the ones I've highlighted, earnings record, pay a divi, etc.
