<b>Title: Checklist for avoiding 'problem' shares - 11-Sep-2015</b>


<p>
Posted by "yump" on ADVFN
  
<li>Are big numbers quoted, but they are actually someone else's big numbers ? (eg. here that would be the billions in transactions)

<li>Are 'pipelines' and 'initiatives' and 'potential' mentioned with a flurry of PR and then not reported on again ? (eg. here that would be the tens of thousands of spend analysis prospects in the UK - anyone remember them ?)

<li>Are changes to a business model presented as positive, when in fact the previous model/business just didn't work or sell much. (In contrast to changing to new business models to improve on an existing model that is actually working)

<p>Those 3 probably enough combined to keep away.
