<b>Title: 3 Quick Rules of Thumbs to Determine a Strong Business</b>

<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Operating Cash Flow</b> - how much real cash the company generates from its core business<br>
  This is the real cash that the business generates; after all the goods sold, expenses and inventory purchase. Note that the cost of inventory is often overlooked.<br>
  Look for: At least 12% of the total capital invested. Rising consistently year over year </li>

<li><b>Free cash flow</b> - how profitable the company is after capital expenditure and loan repayments<br>
  Take the operating cash flow and subtract capex, acquisitions, debt repayment and any dividend<br>
  Look for: FCF positive at least 5 out of the last 10 years</li>

<li><b>ROCE</b><br>
  Divide operating profit by capital employed (quity + debt)<br>
  Look for: ROCE &gt; 10% consistently. Above 15% indicates a strong business. </li>
