<ol>
<li><b>Require ROCE &ge; 15pc</b>.10pc or less is a machine for destroying value
<li><b>Check that profits translate to cash</b>. Compare like with like: Ensure that Net cash flow to net profit or the operating cashflow to the operating profit is at least 90pc. Otherwise, don't bother.
<li><b>How does the company make its returns?</b>. Look for companies that make a large number of everyday repeat predictable transactions. Avoid businesses that make their money on large one-off occasional things (e.g. property, movies)
