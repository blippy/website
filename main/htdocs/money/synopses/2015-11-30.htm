<p>Market traded on CAPE of 27.1

<p>[Sidenote: <a href="http://www.starcapital.de/research/stockmarketvaluation">http://www.starcapital.de/research/stockmarketvaluation</a>
estimates UK CAPE at 12.8 as of 30.10.2015]

<p>Portfolio activity in last 12 months [highlights]:
<li>New positions: Asian Citrus [fraud?], Centrica [Woodford sells], Chemring [too much debt?], Lonmin [oh my God, tell me it isn¡¦t so]
<li>Added: Apollo Education [Jim Chanos: "national shame"]
<li>Reduced: Hewlett-Packard [another Chanos short?], Tinity Mirror [at
least they figured out it was in long term decline], Johnston Press [Paul Scott: "almost certainly terminal"]
<li>Complete sales: Next [their one decent holding]

<p>[holy cows, guys, you must have really held your noses when buying
that bunch of garbage. They're contrarian, I'll give them that!]

<h2>Lonmin</h2>

significant discount to asset value
balance sheet is strong

<p>[I bought Lonmin, but bailed out, thankfully. Schroder¡¦s call was
just plain wrong here, the rights issue pretty much zapped existing
holders]

<h2>Banking</h2>

<p>the most attractive sector
balance sheets have vastly improved yet valuations are still depressed

<p>[the possible downside is that banks will not be able to earn
attractive returns on equity. Schroder's don't make a bad argument,
but time will tell if the results will bear out.]
