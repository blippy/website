<b>Title: GMO on energy - 06-May-2015</b>

<p>
Page 11:
<blockquote>
Early oil wells could deliver well over 100 times the energy 
expended obtaining the oil; today traditional oil wells are around 30:1. Coal is probably higher than 
that.  U.S. fracking and Canadian tar sands are probably in the range of 10:1 or 15:1.  The pessimists 
believe that a ratio of 8:1 is needed to merely maintain what we have: to educate our engineers and to 
build and maintain the roads over which the giant truck that carries the even larger blade for a wind 
tower travels.  You get their point.  Which is a reasonable one, I think.  But although onshore wind 
is a respectable 8:1, solar is still only 4:1, and when energy is invested to smooth out their delivery to 
the grid, their ratios halve.
