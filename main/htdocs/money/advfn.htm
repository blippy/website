<hr><h2>The secret</h2>

On 23-Jul-2013, Cockney Rebel <a href="http://uk.advfn.com/cmn/fbb/thread.php3?id=15789233&from=149336#firstpost">wrote</a>:

<p>I think the secret is to reduce your risk to the max and increase your potential reward from what/when you buy.

<p>Eliminating the dross of 80$ of the risk from AIM by only buying profitable or near profitable AIM co's with a listed track record get's rid of a lot of risk imo.

<p>Buying fully listed stocks where the share are on lows, where most punters have given up, where the chart and director speak suggest recovery might be showing before long means you are likely buying when all the fear and downside is in the price. If you have it wrong and the recovery isn't there yet the downside is limited imo - eswpecially in a bullish market when investors are feeling forgiving - not so in a bear mkt tho imo.


<hr><h2>Rights issues</h2>

On 22-May-2013, <a href="http://uk.advfn.com/forum/search?q=erogenous%20jones&index=posts&post_poster=on">erogenous jones</a> <a href="http://uk.advfn.com/cmn/fbb/thread.php3?id=29339025&from=4334#firstpost">wrote</a> wrt TCG: I am expecting that in common with previous rights issues in which I have participated, the share price will be pretty flat until the rights issue closes. At that point the SP will fall back 20% or so but there is still the opportunity to acquire shares at a discount to the market rate.

It will then give opportunity for those short to close their position once admitted to the market and trading in the new shares takes place. I would expect to see some substantial volumes transacted in the days following which might give false signals to trigger bargains.

<hr><h2>Big moves</h2>

On 30-May-2013, Saucepan <a href="http://uk.advfn.com/cmn/fbb/thread.php3?id=23688471&from=7249#firstpost">writes</a>:<br>
GAH exemplifies your point about large movements with no explanation; though in my experience:

<li> Big moves are often made after a period of consolidation.
<li> Big moves often occur two or three weeks before known results dates or dates when news is due. (I am hoping GBO will be the exemplar of this as we know we have a trading update on 10 June. It will be interesting to see!)

<p>I also like cup and handle chart formations. The GBO chart in the top right of the header looks like one that is resolving successfully.

In summary, I still keep some faith in technicals and seem to do well from them.

However, except on the rarest of occasions, I will only be looking at a stock from a technical perspective because I am already convinced of the value/growth.

So, in effect, I try to get the best of both worlds. It does not always work of course!

<hr><h2>Dividend cutters</h2>

On TMF on 20-May-2013, tjh290633 told about his experience with companies that cut their dividends. The results seemed about 50:50 as to whether they were good:bad opportunities. <a href="http://boards.fool.co.uk/so-what-would-you-do-about-first-group-yes-i-12811915.aspx">xlink</a>


<hr><h2>CR's auctions</h2>

Auction points are often great reversal or mid-term bottoms.

<hr><h2>CR bowls</h2>

barefoot141 - I'm not into chart expertise, I'm into trends only.

I noticed a lot of bowls at the low in 2003 and looked out for them and found loads more at the 2009 bottom. You see most at market bottoms, they gradually get harder to find as a market matures imo, at least good ones do.

What I look for is a decline that's gently reducing then a corresponding bounce that start to mirror the previous fall.

I'd say about half tend to go back to where the original fall started, about 30% carry on and go even higher and 20% fall before they get back to the point where the fall started.

There's no hard and fast rule for me. You watch the trend and the longer and firmer it stays in place the more confident you can be of it. If it fails and the bowl shape goes wrong then it's probably time to leave imo.

<hr><h2>CR recovery stocks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Board Changes
  <li>Chart turning positive
  <li>News starting to sound better
  <li>Directors buying
  <li>Broker sentiment improving
</ul>

<p>Firstly, the bounces last time were with the same old board in place. Had the same board been in place now, you wouldn't see me here. Bad boards don't change - you need to change a board to get an improved performance. If I buy a recovery stock I expect the new board to start to show me meaningful improvements that the market can tangibly see within 12-18 months. Good new boards can do that sooner, especially if there's loads of scope for improvement.

<p>The shares also bottomed in July when Green took the helm coincidently - she has a proven track record.

<p>After the last results the directors hurridly bought shares, a sign of confidence imo.

<p>Brokers turning positive, there has been two brokers going overweight on TCG recently - unheard of in the past two years. They won't all be positive, some will be slow to notice the change is working, others will drag their feet while putting their clients into TCG and then they start turning more positive imo. Some will always be negative as they are always behind the curve. When all the brokers are positive that's the time to think about selling.

<p>TCG has all 5 of the feature I look for in a recovery. It's when punters expect a recover from a company with a board that has consistently under-performed that they get disappointed imo.

<hr><h2>CR's trading rules</h2>

Rules recommended by CockneyRebel:
<ul>
  <li>Don't catch a falling knife.    
  <li>Buy something that's going up, rather than something that's cheap.
  <li>If in doubt, get out.
  <li>If it's chart v fundamentals go with the chart.
  <li>Bad directors don't become good directors.
  <li>Stay away from AIM if it's based overseas.
  <li>Watch director trades and do as they do rather than do as they say.
  <li>Don't read the words in the results, read between the words.
  <li>Buy boring, sell exciting. Look for dead bulletin board threads to buy.
  <li>Try to swim with the tide rather than against it.
  <li>Be a contrarian - when everyone dislikes a stock or sector that's usually the best time to buy.
</ul>
