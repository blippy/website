<h1>UK Stock Challenge 2016</h1>

<hr><h2>Yearly entries</h2>

WIG (Winning Income &amp; Growth) Screen was my first port of call, as it has high returns with low volatility. DTG seemed too good to pass up, and IGG was recommended by John Kingham. I wanted to choose one share from each sector, but figured that doubling up in consumer defensive was acceptable. It seemed as though it would make a good barbell strategy in the style of Nassim Taleb: get some good safe companies (SBRY, TET), and combine them with a risky one (PAF).

<p>My entries for 2016 are are follows:

<pre>
EPIC  SR   PV50  #SCREENS SECTOR   NOTES
DTG   99  14.9%      9    Indus    Good momo, EV/EBITDA 2.26. Bought some new planes
IGG   83   4.6%      1    Finance  Passes value momo screen. High ROCE and diviended growth
PAF   86  -3.1%      1    Bas Mat  Passes WIG. Risky gold play amongst safer choices. PE 4.2
SBRY  95   1.7%      4    Cons def Passes WIG, and should be safe choice
TET   96   1.7%      2    Cons def Passes WIG, and should be safe. High ROCE and good div growth
