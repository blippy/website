<h1>Greenblatt</h1>


<hr><h2>05-Oct-2012 Lecture notes</h2>

A good business has high returns on tangible capital (after-tax EBITA/(net PP&amp;E + W/c)) i.e. ROTC well above 10%.

<p>Greenblatt looks for where upside is 5X downside - big potential gains, limited losses. Fore example, price is 40, downside is 35, upside is 65+ (down 5, up 25). Focus on best opportunities - only own 5-8 stocks at one time, and hold for 1-5 years, i.e. only invests in one or two stocks per year.

<p>Be patient. He seldom adds to positions if they decline - buy right first time, because there are no do-overs.

<hr><h2>Valueprax's Review of Quantitative Value</h2>

Valueprax presents a review of the book that tries to improve on the Magic Formula.

<p>
<ul>
<li>Any sample of high-return stocks will contain a few stocks with genuine franchises but consist mostly of stocks at the peak of their business cycle... mean reversion is faster when it is further from its mean
<li>the simplest form of the enterprise multiple (the EBIT variation) is superior to alternative price ratios
<li>trading on opportunistic insider buys and sells generates around 8 percent market-beating return per year. Trading on routine insider buys and sells generates no additional return
<li>short money is smart money... short sellers are able to identify overvalued stocks to sell and also seem adept at avoiding undervalued stocks
<li>Collecting more and more information about a stock will not improve the accuracy of our decision to buy or not as much as it will increase our confidence about the decision... keep the strategy austere
<li>the Magic Formula underperformed its price metric, the EBIT enterprise multiple... ROC actually detracts from the Magic Formula's performance. the quality measures don't warrant as much weight as the price ratio because they are ephemeral. Why pay up for something that's just about to evaporate back to the mean?
<li>the QV strategy compared favorably in a number of important metrics and was superior in terms of CAGR with vaunted value funds such as Sequoia, Legg Mason and Third Avenue.
