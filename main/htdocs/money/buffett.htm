<h1>Buffett</h1>


<p>I noted on a website on 25-Aug-2012: "Buffett looks at EBIT/EV, and
he'll pay 7x for a decent business".

Sketch notes follow on video posted by marketfolly.

<p>Buffett said: even if you're a slightly above average investor who spends less than they earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but become rich if you are patient.

<p>Munger said that if an investor did just 3 things, their end results would be vastly better that the rest:
<li>carefully look at what the other great investors have done - don't be afraid to copy
<li>look at the cannibals - i.e companies that are buying back their own stock
<li>carefully study spinoffs
