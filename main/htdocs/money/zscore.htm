<p>Z-Score. A ratio devised by Robert Altman to describe the financial health 
  of a company, and its likelihood of financial distress. Z-Score works best with 
  manufacturing companies, but not at all with financials and property companies. 
</p>
<p>Given:</p>
<ul>
  <li> TA - Total assets</li>
  <li>TL - Total liabilities</li>
  <li>WC - Working capital (that is, stocks and debtors less short term creditors)</li>
  <li>RE - Accumulated retained earnings (the profit and loss account reserve)</li>
  <li> EBIT - earnings before interest and tax</li>
  <li>S - Sales</li>
  <li>MC - Market Capitalisation. </li>
</ul>
<p>define:</p>
<ul>
  <li>X1 = WC/TA : This measures liquid assets in relation to the firm's size. 
    Altman, interestingly, mentions that the most widely used current and acid 
    ratios were not as good predictors as this measure.</li>
  <li>X2 = RE/TA : This is a measure of cumulative profitability that reflects 
    the firm's age as well as earning power. Many studies have shown failure rates 
    to be closely related to the age of the business.</li>
  <li>X3 = EBIT/TA : This is a measure of operating efficiency separated from 
    any leverage effects. It recognizes operating earnings as a key to long-run 
    viability.</li>
  <li>X4 = MC/TL : This ratio adds a market dimension. Academic studies of stock 
    markets suggest that security price changes may foreshadow upcoming problems.</li>
  <li>X5 = S/TA : This is a standard turnover measure. Unfortunately, it varies 
    greatly from one industry to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Z-score is: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Z = (1.2 * X1) + (1.4 * X2) + (3.3 * X3) + ( 0.6 * X4) + ( 1.0 * X5) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For <b>manufacturing</b> companies, Z &lt; 1.8 indicates a bankruptcy candidate, 
  Z &gt; 3 indicates strong health.</p>
<p>For <b>nonmanufacturing</b> companies, X5 varies significantly by industry. 
  It is likely to be higher for merchandising and service firms than for manufacturers, 
  since the former are typically less capital intensive. Consequently, nonmanufacturers 
  would have significantly higher asset turnover and Z scores. The model is thus 
  likely to underpredict certain sorts of bankruptcy. To correct for this potential 
  defect, Altman recommends the following formula:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Z = (6.56 * X1) + (3.26 * X2) + (6.72 * X3) + (1.05 * X4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Z &lt; 1.1 indicates a bankruptcy candidate, Z &gt; 2.6 indicates financial 
  health. </p>
