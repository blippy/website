<h1>shorting</h1>



<hr><h2>High momentum and shorts portfolio</h2>


<p>PRO FORMA

<p>According to The Globe and Mail (<a href="http://is.gd/CfG1gX">http://is.gd/CfG1gX</a>), you can beat the S&amp;P500 by 9.3% pa by investing in large- and mid-cap stocks that are heavily shorted. The gist of their article is that if you bought heavily shorted large and mid-cap stocks, you would have beat the S&amp;P 500 by 9.28% each and every year. Market cap matters a lot, because with with the smaller names, negative returns were delivered.

<p>The precise mechanics of constructing the portfolio has small variations from article to article, but the basic idea is to search for recovery stocks in a mechanical way: stocks that have high short positions, but which show high momentum , suggesting that the shorts were wrong in their analysis. Based on my findings in the Feb 2014 article, it appears that the strategy can work for glamour stocks as well as recovery stocks.
