<hr><h2>Commentary 24-Oct-2010</h2>

EAGA first caught my eye because of its promising stats:
<pre>
SP    68.5P
MKT  171.6M
YLD    5.8%
PER    4.7
GEAR -24%
ICOV  45
Z      5.4
BSR    0.0 (=1306/29349)
ROE   23.7%
ROA   25.3%
</pre>

These numbers are exellent in all respects. Yield is high, and PER is low. Financial safety is 
high (as measured by GEAR, ICOV, Z, BSR). Captial return is high (as measured by ROE, ROA). The company appeared in a recent 
trawl for "Magic Formula" shares. Whilst the numbers do indeed look good, I haven't selected it as a company that I am 
interested in buying. I am worried about it - as the area that it trades in seems rather too much of a "fad" to me. We
have windmills going up in our area, and it struck me that all this activity is the result of government stimulus, 
rather than a sustainable economic endeavour. 

<p>In my opinion, there seem too many "buzzwordy" activities that the company undertakes. I am talking about "carbon economy", 
"social landlords", and "fuel proverty programmes". What's worrying, in my opinion, is that the company seems to be heavily 
reliant on the prevailing political climate (if you'll forgive the pun) in favour of "sustainable energy". 
My question is this: what happens when sustainable energy is no longer an interest of the government, and the technology 
proves to be too expensive economically?</p>

<p>We can see just how vulnerable EAGA is to adverse developments. 
An <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSLDE69J25420101020" >article</a> on written on 20-Oct-2010 at Reuters states:
<blockquote>
<b>Eaga hit by UK govt's phasing out of fuel scheme</b> : 

British energy efficiency firm Eaga (EAGA.L) said it will consider how it will be impacted after the government announced plans to cut spending on a fuel scheme by more than it was expecting, hurting its shares.

As part of a spending review on Wednesday aimed at slashing the UK's budget deficit, the government said it would phase out the Warm Front scheme which provides grants to help people in fuel poverty. [ID:nLDE69J0G8]

Eaga said the budget announced by the government for the scheme for the next two years was materially lower than its expectations.

Shares in the company plunged after the news closing down 23 percent at 83.5 pence, their lowest level since the company floated in 2008, and valuing the company at 210 million pounds ($330 million).
</blockquote>

An <a href="http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=201010201555077296U" >RNS article</a> by EAGA on Investegate reports on 20-Oct-2010:
<blockquote>
<b>Statement re Spending Review</b> : This statement confirmed that the Warm Front Scheme would be phased out as part of the transition to 
"Green Deal". ... These areas represent significant opportunities which Eaga is pursuing. 
</blockquote>

It is interesting to note how much disparity there is between EAGA's confidence in seeing "significant opportunities", and the Reuters 
article on budget reduction and the city's reaction to the news.
</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how this progresses. I could be wrong, but I think there's a salutory lesson here: don't invest in a company 
that is reliant on a single customer or political landscape. Beware of something that seems to be a new trend. Another note of caution, which
I also found a little worrying: the company only floated two years ago. The company could, of course, pick up and go on to produce great 
things. I think there's considerable risk, though. So it's not one of those Buffett-esque investments.</p>
