<hr><h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>30-Jun-2014 Share valuation</h3>

Using a two-phase Damodaran growth model: valuation 355p, current share price 207p. <a href="http://mcturra2000.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/dtg-dart-group-valuation-350p/">My wordpress blog article</a>, including code.

<h3>26-Jun-2014: RNS: prelims</h3>

Operating profit increased by 30% to £49.2m, pre-tax profit by 4% to
£42.1, EPS grew by 14% to 24.68%, dividends by 47%. BUT. Reduced
buoyancy in leisure travel leads them to expect the current year
operating profit outturn to be lower than market expectations. The
Market is also worried about the legal ruling for compensation claims
on delayed flights. Paul Scott says that Dart looks great value, with
a PER of 7.6X. Share price closed at 190p, down 24.4%.


<h3>Buy 16-Dec-2013</h3>

<p>I bought these today 235p. Why?
<li>It was selected by IR35x for the NFSC 2014. YTD for 2013, he is in the 75th percentile for performance, and beating the market by an enormous margin. So he has form
<li>Stockopedia gives this company a stock rank of 98.
<li>Stockopedia expects a 60% rise relative to sector valuations. DTGS is trading on a PSR of 0.39, for example, whereas the airline sector is on a mean PSR of 0.68
<li>Stockopedia gives DTG a Graham upside of 104%. So the stock should double.
<li>Double-digit revenue growth is expected, likewise for EPS, yet the company trades on a PE of 10.8
<li>Mean FCF over the last 4 years was 36.10p. That gives it a P/FCF of 6.5, which is a bargain under most circumstances, but doubly so given the expected growth
