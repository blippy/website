<hr><h2>Commentary 31-Oct-2010</h2>


On 29-Jun-2010 I bought 2846 shares of CNT at 35p, for 999.88 GBP. On 04-Aug-2010 I sold them all for 31p a share. In retrospect, I obtained a good deal on the sale because it has gone into administration. Not such a good purchase, of course.

Here's a potted recent history:
<li>08-Sep-2010 Appointment of administrator</li>
<li>07-Sep-2010 CNT suspended from LSE. The Group now believes that the availability of additional funds from its lenders will not be forthcoming and, whilst it remains in discussions with other parties, the ability to provide an adequate solution to the funding issues the Group faces has become increasingly uncertain. </li> 

What did CNT is the government cutbacks. It was reliant on government contracts to keep it going. There also seem to have been concerns over the true state of its finances. Its interest cover at 27-Apr-2010 was 8.2 - quite a safe figure. Its z-score was 1.8 - warning signal to be sure - but in prior years, it looked reasonably robust. To me it didn't look too bad at the time, which prompted me to invest. However, it became clearer soon after that the company had possibly a fatal wound, leading me to bail out soon after. It is, possibly, my tendency towards contrariness that gets me into these icky situations.
