<h1>Graham</h1>

<hr><h2>Simplest way</h2>

This formula apparently appeared in Medical Economics 20-Sep-1976, titled "The Simplest Way to Select Bargain Stocks". Graham was 82 at the time. Selection Criteria:

<ol>
  <li>Cheapness: stock having an earning yield (inverse of PER) that is at least twice as big as the average yield on long-term AAA corporate bonds, or 10%, whichever is greater
<li>Safety: leverage ratio <= 2. Leverage ratio is is the total assets to shareholder's equity.
</ol>

Aim to build a portfolio of 30 stocks. You need to give the program a minimum of five years to work.

<p>Selling criteria: two years or 50% profit, whichever came first.
