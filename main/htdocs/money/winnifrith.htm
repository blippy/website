<hr><h2>Placings</h2>

Signs that a placing are underway in a way that will disadvantage you:
<li>The house broker will normally be prohibited from publishing research just before a placing. So watch for a raft of notes from "independent" research houses such as Edison and Hardman.
<li>The CEO will do a raft of interviews with folks like Proactive Investors and in resources present at Proactive or Minesite or similar forums.
<li>The PR folks will call in favours and you will see the shares tipped in magazines and puffed up in certain parts of the press.
<li>There will be a string of upbeat RNS releases. Most companies that are loss making seem to issue an RNS once a month with good news anyway. But when it becomes even more frequent than usual watch out.

<p>Score three of four on this checklist and then do your maths â€“ is the company likely to need cash within 18 months? If so the placing is on its way.
