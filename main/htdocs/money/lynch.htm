<hr><h2>25 rules</h2>
<p>Rule 1: Investing is fun and exciting, but dangerous if you don't do any work.

<p>Rule 2: Your investor's edge is not something you get from Wall Street experts. It's something you already have. You can outperform the experts if you use your edge by investing in companies or industries you already understand.

<p>Rule 3: Over the past 3 decades, the stock market has come to be dominated by a herd of professional investors. Contrary to popular belief, this makes it easier for the amateur investor. You can beat the market by ignoring the herd.

<p>Rule 4: Behind every stock is a company. Find out what it's doing.

<p>Rule 5: Often, there is no correlation between the success of a company's operations and the success of its stock over a few months or even a few years. In the long term, there is a 100% correlation between the success of the company and the success of its stock. This disparity is the key to making money; it pays to be patient, and to own successful companies.

<p>Rule 6: You have to know what you own, and why you own it. "This baby is a cinch to go up" doesn't count.

<p>Rule 7: Long shots almost always miss the mark.

<p>Rule 8: Owning stocks is like having children - don't get involved with more than you can handle. The part-time stockpicker probably has time to follow 8-12 companies, and to buy and sell shares as conditions warrant. There don't have to be more than 5 companies in the portfolio at any one time.

<p>Rule 9: If you can't find any companies that you think are attractive, put your money in the bank until you discover some.


<p>Rule 10: Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets. Always look at the balance sheet to see if a company is solvent before you risk your money on it.

<p>Rule 11: Avoid hot stocks in hot industries. Great companies in cold, non-growth industries are consistent big winners.

<p>Rule 12: With small companies, you are better off to wait until they turn a profit before you invest.

<p>Rule 13: If you are thinking of investing in a troubled industry, buy the companies with staying power. Also, wait for the industry to show signs of revival. Buggy whips and radio tubes were troubled industries that never came back.

<p>Rule 14: If you invest $1000 in a stock, all you can lose is $1000, but you stand to gain $10,000 or even $50,000 over time if you are patient. The average person can concentrate on a few good companies, while the fund manager is forced to diversify. By owning too many stocks, you lose this advantage of concentration. It only takes a handful of big winners to make a lifetime of investing worthwhile.

<p>Rule 15: In every industry and every region of the country, the observant amateur can find great growth companies long before the professionals have discovered them.

<p>Rule 16: A stock market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If you are prepared, it can't hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic.

<p>Rule 17: Everyone has the brainpower to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and stock mutual funds altogether.

<p>Rule 18: There is always something to worry about. Avoid weekend thinking and ignore the latest dire predictions of the newscasters. Sell a stock because the company's fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.

<p>Rule 19: Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy, or the stock market, Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what's actually happening to the companies in which you have invested.

<p>Rule 20: If you study 10 companies, you will find 1 for which the story is better than expected. If you study 50, you'll find 5. There are always pleasant surprises to be found in the stock market - companies whose achievements are being overlooked on Wall Street.

<p>Rule 21: If you don't study any companies, you have the same success buying stocks as you do in a poker game if you bet without looking at your cards.

<p>Rule 22: Time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. You can afford to be patient - even if you missed Wal-Mart in the first five years, it was a great stock to own in the next five years. Time is against you when you own options.

<p>Rule 23: If you have the stomach for stocks, but neither the time nor the inclination to do the homework, invest in equity mutual funds. Here, it's a good idea to diversify. You should own a few different kinds of funds, with managers who pursue different styles of investing: growth, value small companies, large companies etc. Investing the six of the same kind of fund is not diversification.

<p>Rule 24: Among the major stock markets of the world, the U.S. market ranks 8th in total return over the past decade. You can take advantage of the faster-growing economies by investing some portion of your assets in an overseas fund with a good record.

<p>Rule 25: In the long run, a portfolio of well-chosen stocks and/or equity mutual funds will always outperform a portfolio of bonds or a money-market account. In the long run, a portfolio of poorly chosen stocks won't outperform the money left under the mattress.

<hr><h2>Using your edge</h2>

<li>invest in what you know
<li>let your winners run
<li>three are two ways investors can fake themselves out of big returns: 1) waiting until it looks cheap (Wal-Mart never looked cheap - its PER rarely dropped below 20). A PER of 20 is not too much to pay for a company growing at 25 percent. 2)underestimating low long a great growth company can keep up the pace. (in the 1970s everyone said that McDonalds had seen its best days. Lynch actually found that there were fewer McD's in California, its origin, than there were branches of Bank of America).
<li>when yield on long-term government bonds exceed the dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 by 6 percent or more, sell stocks and buy bonds
<li>know the reason you bought the stock
<li>pay attention to facts, not forecasts
<li>look for a risk-reward ratio of 3:1 or better
<li>be patient (he often had to wait 2-3 years before his bets paid off)
<li>Enter early (investing in growth companies in the 3rd inning)
<li>buy cheap stocks not because they're just cheap but because fundamentals improve

<hr><h2>Beating the Street</h2>

<p>p 66 Graph showing small caps versus S&amp;P 500.

<p>p85 My diaries are full of such missed opportunities, but the stock market is merciful - it awlays gives the nincompoop a second chance.

<p>p 103 After every contact I made, on the phone or in person, I'd scribble a notation in a loose-leaf binder - the name of the company and the current stock price, followed by a one- or two-line summary of the story I'd just heard. 

<p>p 108 From watching the  ups and downs of various industries, I learned that wherease it was possible to make two to five times your money in cyclicals and undervalued situations (assuming that all went well), there were bigger payoffs in the retailers and the restaurants. Not only did they grow as fast as the high-tech growth companies (computer manufacturers, software manufacturers, medical enterprises), but they were generally less risky. A computer company can lose half its value overnight when a rival unveils a better prodcut, but a chain of donut franchises in New England is not going to lose business when somebody opens a superior donut franchise in Ohio. It may take a decade for the competitor to arrive, and investors can see it coming.

<p>p 110 When yield on long-term government bonds exceed the dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 by 6 percent or more, sell your stocks and buy bonds.

<p>p 124 With U.S. insurance companies, the rates go up months before the earnings start to show any improvement. These stocks are like cyclicals. If you buy them when the rates first begin to rise, you can make a lot of money. It is not uncommon for an insurance stock to double after a rate increase and double again on the higher earnings that result from the rate increase. E.g. Skandia, which writes property/casualty policies.

<p>p 154 in double-decker malls, the most popular retailers are usually found upstairs. The managers arrange it that way so as many customers as possible pass by as many stores as possible on their way to the busiest, and therefore most profitable, haunts.

<p>p 158 A stock doesn't care who owns it, and questions of greed are best resolved in church or in the psychiatrist's office, not in the retirement account.

<p>p 159 In a retail company or a restaurant chain, the growth that propels earnings and the stock price comes mainly from expansion. As long as the same-store sales are on the increas, the company is not crippled by excessive debt, and it is following its expansion plans as described to shareholders in its reports, it usually pays to stick with the stock.

<p>p 182 As a place to invest, I'll take a lousy industry over a great industry anytime. In a lousy industry, one that's growing slowly if at all, the weak drop out and the survivors get a bigger share of the market. A company that can capture an ever-increasing share of a stagnant market is a lot better off than one that has to struggle to preotect a dwindling share of an exciting market. The greatest companies in lousy industries share certain characteristics. The are low-cost operators, and penny-pinchers in the executive suite. They avoid getting into debt. They find niches, parts of the market that bigger companies have overlooked. They grow fast - faster than many companies in the fashionable fast-growth industries.

<p>p 184 In the 1090s, what business was worse than the airline business> Eastern, Pan Am, Braniff, Continental, and Midway went bankrupt, and several others were on the verge of doing so, yet in this disasterous 10-year stretch the stock in Southwest Airlines roes from $2.40 to $24. Why? Mostly because of all the things Southwest Airlines didn't do. It didn't fly to Paris, it didn't serve fancy meals, it didn't borrow too much money to buy too many airplanes, it didn't overpay its executives, and it didn't give its workers a good reason to resent the company.

<p>p 10. On assessing S&amp;L's: <b>Equity-t-Assets Ratio</b> - the most important number of all. Measures financial strength and "survivability". The higher the E/A, the better. E/A of 1 or 2 indicates scrap heap. Below 5 is danger zone of ailing thrifts. 5.5 to 6 is average.An E/A of 20 would make it four times stronger than JP Morgan. Lynch recommends an E/A of at least 7.5. This is not only for disaster protection, but makes it an attractive takeover candidate. <b>Dividend</b> : a high yield is a plus. <b>Book value</b> : look for selling at well below book value. <b>P/E Ratio</b> : the lower the better. Some of them can be on 7 or 8. Lynch also mentions calculations of High-Risk Real-Estate Asets, 90-Day Nonperforming Assets, REO (Real Estate Owned - these are foreclosures)

<p>p 224 I find general gllom in an industry far less bothersome than if a specific company struggles while its competitors thrive. Nevertheless, in a telling paragraph in its third-quarter report for 1991, Green Acres admitted it might forgo a penny a year increase in its dividends. This apparently innocuous action was an attention-getter. If a company has raised its dividend 13 quarters in a row, as Green Acres had, it has powerful built-in incentive to continue the string. To break it it for the sake of a penny, or a grand total of $100,000, I suspected was symptomatic of deeper troubles.

<p>p 224 Buying on the bad news can be a very costly strategy, especially since bad news has a habit of getting worse.

<p>p 225 Buying on the good news is healthier in the long run, and you improve your odds considerably by waiting for the proof.

<p>p 228 you can figure out if a company is a low-cost operator by looking at its gross margins.

<p>p 233 When the p/e ratios of cyclical companies are very low, it's usually a sign that they are at the end of a prosperous interlude.

<p>p 234 Buying a cyclical after several years of record earnings and when the p/e ratio has hit a low point is a proven method for losing half your money in a short period of time. Conversely, a high p/e ratio, which with most stocks is regarded as a bad thing, may be good news for a cyclical. Often, it means that a company is passing through the worst of the doldrums, and soon its business will improve, the earnings will exceed the analysts' expectations, and fund managers will start buying the stock in earnest. Thus, the price of the stock will go up..

<p>p 234 My own record with cyclicals is moderately good, and whenever there's a recession I pay attention to this group. The comeback of a depressed cyclical with a strong balance sheet is inevitable.

<p>p 236 The most important question to ask about a cyclical is whether the company's balance sheet is strong enough to survive the next downturn. Lynch looks at net debt to shareholder equity. In his example on Phelps Dodge, it had net debt of $318m, and shareholder equity of $1,682m. In a big company, Lynch will want to do a separate valuation on each part of the business, and add them up. There may be a sizeable hidden asset. It's not unusual to discover that the parts are worth more than the whole. If you take the earnings of each division and multiply by a generic p/e ratio (say, 8-10 for a cyclical on average earnings, or 3-4 on peak earnings), you'll get at least a rough idea of how much the division is worth.

<p>p 240 The autos, often misidentified as blue chips, are classic cyclicals. One useful indicator for when to buy into auto stocks is used-car prices. When used-car dealers lower their prices, it means they're having trouble selling cars, and a lousy market for them is even lousier for the new-car dealers. But when used-car prices are on the rise, it's a sign of good times ahead for the automaker.

<p>p 241 An even more reliable indicator is "units of pent-up demand". Lynch gives a table on p 242. For a number of years, calculate actual sales in units, against a trend figure. Calculate the units above or below trend. Calculate cumulative figures on the units above/(below) trend. This gives you an idea of pent-up demand.  After four or five years when sales are under the trend, it takes another four or five years of sales above the trend before tha car market can catch up to itself. If you didn't know this, you might sell your auto stocks too soon. Sell when the pent-up demand is all used up.

<p>p 243 But in the stock market it rarely pays to take yesterday's news too seriously, or hold an opinion too long. As GM was declining, the popular view on Wall Street was that this was a powerful company with a profitable future. In 1991, the popular view was that GM was a weak company with a miserable future. Though I was no fan of GM in the past, my hunch was that this latest popular opinion would prove to be as misguided as the last one.

<p>p 245 Fore brief periods at Magellan, I had 10 percent of the fund invested in utilities. Usually this happened when interest rates were declining and the economy was in a sputter. In other words, I treated the utilities as interest-rate cyclicals, and tried to time my entrances and my exits accordingly. But the utilities with which I've done the best have been the troubled ones.

<p>p 246 The reason my record with troubled utilities is better than with troubled companies in general is that utilities are regulated by the government. A utility may declare bankruptcy and/or eliminate its dividend, but as long as people need electricity, a way must be found for the utility to continue to function.

<p>In the distressed utilities you had a long time to profit from each of these four recoveries, which, according to the three analysts, proceeded trhough four recognisable stages. In the first stage, disaster strikes. The utility is faced with a sudden loss of earnings, either because some huge cost (the increase in fuel prices in Con Ed's case) cannot be passed along to customers, or because a huge asset (usually the nuke plant) is mothballed and removed from the rate base. The stock suffers accordingly and loses anywhere from 40 percent to 80 percent of its value in a one- to two-year period. These drops are horrifying to people who regard utilities as safe and stable investments.

<p>p 247 Soon enough, the distressed utility is trading at 20-30 percent of book value. The stock has taken this drubbing because Wall Street is worried that the damage to the company may be fatal, especially when a multibillion-dollar nuke plant has been shut down. How long it takes to reverse this impression varies from disaster to disaster. With Long Island Lighting, the threat of bankruptcy kept the stock selling at 30 percent of book value for four years.

<p>In the second stage, which our trio of experts calls "crisis management", the utility attempts to respond to the disaster by currint capital spending and adopting an austerity budget. As part of the austerity, the dividend on the stock is reduced or eliminated. It is beginning to look as if the company will survive its difficulties, but the stock price doesn't reflect the improved propsects.

<p>In the thrid stage, "financial stabilisation", management has succeeded in cutting costs to the point that the utility can operate on the cash it receives from its bill-paying customers. The capital markets may be unwilling to lend it monty for any new projects, and the utility is still not earning anything for its shareholders, but survival is no longer in doubt. The stock price has recovered somewhat, and the shares are now selling at 60-70 percent of book value. People who bought the stock in stages one and two have doubled their money.

<p>In stage four, "recovery at last!", the utility once again is capable of earning something for the shareholders, and Wall Street has reason to expect improved earnings and the reinstatement of the dividend. The shares now sell at book value. How things progress from there depends on two factors: (1) the reception from the capital markets, because without capital the utility cannot expand the rate base, and (2) the support, or nonsupport, of the regulators, i.e., how many costs they allow the utility to pass along to the customers in the form of higher rates.

<p>p 248 Buy on the omission of the dividend and wait for the good news. Or, buy when the first good news has arrived in the second stage. The problem that some people have with this is that if a stock falls to $4 and then rises to $8, they think they have missed it. A troubled nuke has a long way to go, and you have to forget about the fact that you missed the bottom.

<p>This suggests a simple way to make a nice living from troubled utilities: buy them when the dividend is omitted and hold on to them until the dividend is restored. This is a strategy with a terrific success ratio.

<p>p 281 A restaurant chain, like a retailer, has 15-20 years of fast growth ahead of it as it expands. This is supposed to be a cutthroat business, but the fledgling restaurant company is protected from competition in a way that an electronics company is not. If there's a new fish-and-chips chain in California and a better ne in New York, what's the impact of the New York chain on the California chain? Zero. Denny;s ir Oizza Hut never gas ti worry about low-cost Korean imports.

<p>What continues to separate the triumphs from the flops among the restaurant chains is capable management, adequate financing, and a methodical approach to expansion. Slow but steady may not win the Indianapolis 500, but it wins this kind of race.

<p>p 283 Any time you can find a 25 percent grower for 20 time earnings, it's a buy.

<p>p 284 You've got to follow the stories. You are trying to get answers to two basic questions: (1) is the stock still attractively priced relative to earnings, and (2) what is happening in the company to make the earnings go up?

<p>Here you can reach one of three conclusions: (1) the story has gotten better, in which case you might want to increase your investment, (2) the story has gotten worse, in which case you can decrease your investment, or (3) the story's unchanged, in which case you can either stick with your investment or put the money into another company with more exciting prospects.

<p>p 293 When the best company in a industry is selling at a bargain price, it often pays to buy that one, as opposed to investing in a lesser competitor that may be selling at a lower price.

<p>p 294 "If you have a choice between reaching your goal in fifteen or in five years, fiftenn is better", I advised the CEO of Supercuts in July.

<p>p 294 Take the industry that's surrounded with the most doom and gloom, and if the fundamentals are positive, you'll find some big winners.
