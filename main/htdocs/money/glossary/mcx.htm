<h1>MCX: Maintenance Capital</h1>

Bruce Greenwald's Method to calculate maintenance capex
<ul>
  <li>Calculate the Average Gross Property Plant and Equipment (PPE)/ sales ratio over 7 years
  <li>Calculate current year's increase in sales    
  <li>Multiply PPE/Sales ratio by increase in sales to arrive to growth capex
  <li>MCX is capex from the cashflow statement less growth capex calculated above, which is the true depreciation for the company 
    </ul>
