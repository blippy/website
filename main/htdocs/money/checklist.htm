<h1>Investment Checklist</h1>


<hr>
02-Aug-2015, updated 16-Nov-2015. Checklist for monthly purchases using stock ranks

The basic checklist would be:
<ul>
  <li>Yield &gt; 2%    
  <li>PE &le; 20    
  <li>ROCE5 &ge; 15%    
  <li>Net debt &lt; 10% * mkt    
  <li>Profit before tax * 3 &le; net debt
  <li>Div CAGR &gt; 5.5%    
  <li>At most two falls in revenue in the last decade (to prevent cyclicity)
</ul>

Getting fancy:
<ul>
<li>SR &ge; 90
<li>Not AIM
<li>Yield &ge; 2.5%
<li>Yield &ge; 3.0%
<li>cash flow statement
<li>spread &lt; 5%
<li>momentum
<li>RS6m not in bottom decile
<li>EV/MKT &le; 1.1 (pref net cash)
<li>ROCE5  
<li>Intangibles/Fixed Assets  
<li>9-year growth in shares in issue  
<li>CAGR divs per Stockopedia
<li>Q(quality) score &ge; 80
<li>No fraud concerns from Paul Scott
</ul>

Deal breakers:
<ul>
  <li>listing &lt; 5 years
  <li>foreign company
  <li>never made a profit
</ul>    

<hr>
27-May-2015 Some ideas to consider that have yet to form a solid base:

<ul>
<li>Index. AIM is riskier than full listing, but potentially more rewarding
<li>5 year ROCE
<li>5 year growth rater
<li>5 year annualised growth in dividend
<li>current yield
<li>operating margins vs historic - it may help you find turnarounds
<li>share price 5 years ago - to help distinguish between turnarounds and growth
<li>director deals
<li>net cash
<li>does it keep issuing shares?
<li>numbers that are too good to be true?
</ul>

<b>Dealbreakers</b> If a company satisifies any of these criteria, then it's an immediate reject:

<ol>
<li>listing less than 5 years (exceptions: government issues, and spin-offs)
<li>Chinese/Israeli/Indian/African/etc
<li>never made a profit
</ol>

Prior to 27-May-2015:

<p>This page was inspired by the fact that Monosh Pabrai uses to
checklists to help him improve his investment decision-making. I
present here my checklist, which I expect to update periodically as I
identify more and more investment mistakes that I make:

<ul>
<li>positive news</li>
<li>EPS isn't abnormally high - so as to prevent using an abnormal PER</li>
<li>several years listing on the stock market - I suggest 7 - to prevent being caught up in favourable temporary business environment of the company</li>
<li>not reliant on one supplier or one customer - for fairly obvious reason</li>  

<li>0.5 total liabilities to total assets</li>

<li>debtors days</li>

<li>net cash flows against net profits</li>

<li>John Chew suggested: <ol>
<li>Is this a good business by ROIC, ROE, ROA?</li>
<li>What is it? Sales, profits, cash flows growing, slowing, declining, volatile?</li>
<li>Debt? How much and what terms?</li>
<li>How is management compensated and do they have skin in the game?</li>
<li>Do I have a hope of understanding this business?</li>
</li><ol>
</ul>

A few more I thought of:
<li>Trend of Operating margins, num of shares

<hr>
<p>Checklist derived 19-Mar-2012 DB02/47:
<li>PER
<li>ROE
<li>Debt
<li>Revenue growth (look for 20% over 2 years, which is about 10% pa)
<li>num share - check that number of shares is not ballooning, preferrably reducing
<li>length listed - 10 years listing preferrable
<li>ROA - available from Google, although the numbers may be fishy
<li>OPM&ge;15% - suggested by Geoff Gannon on <a href="http://www.gurufocus.com/news/169651/how-to-screen-for-hidden-champions">How to screen for hidden champions</a>
<li>ROIC - should probably be above 15%, more like 17.5%, but preferrably above 20%. I give my ROIC formula on DB02/50.
