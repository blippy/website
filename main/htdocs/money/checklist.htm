<h1>Investment Checklist</h1>

This page was inspired by the fact that Monosh Pabrai uses to
checklists to help him improve his investment decision-making. I
present here my checklist, which I expect to update periodically as I
identify more and more investment mistakes that I make:

<ul>
<li>positive news</li>
<li>EPS isn't abnormally high - so as to prevent using an abnormal PER</li>
<li>several years listing on the stock market - I suggest 7 - to prevent being caught up in favourable temporary business environment of the company</li>
<li>not reliant on one supplier or one customer - for fairly obvious reason</li>  

<li>0.5 total liabilities to total assets</li>

<li>debtors days</li>

<li>net cash flows against net profits</li>

<li>John Chew suggested: <ol>
<li>Is this a good business by ROIC, ROE, ROA?</li>
<li>What is it? Sales, profits, cash flows growing, slowing, declining, volatile?</li>
<li>Debt? How much and what terms?</li>
<li>How is management compensated and do they have skin in the game?</li>
<li>Do I have a hope of understanding this business?</li>
</li><ol>
</ul>

A few more I thought of:
<li>Trend of Operating margins, num of shares

<hr>
<p>Checklist derived 19-Mar-2012 DB02/47:
<li>PER
<li>ROE
<li>Debt
<li>Revenue growth (look for 20% over 2 years, which is about 10% pa)
<li>num share - check that number of shares is not ballooning, preferrably reducing
<li>length listed - 10 years listing preferrable
<li>ROA - available from Google, although the numbers may be fishy
<li>OPM&ge;15% - suggested by Geoff Gannon on <a href="http://www.gurufocus.com/news/169651/how-to-screen-for-hidden-champions">How to screen for hidden champions</a>
<li>ROIC - should probably be above 15%, more like 17.5%, but preferrably above 20%. I give my ROIC formula on DB02/50.
