Generation", and by </footer><footer>James O'Shaughnessey
in "What Works on Wall Street".</footer></p>

<p><footer>Dreman presents lots of tables, so I have
decided to present just the highlights. That's why, for example, I have
only shown the results for the outlying quintile. </footer><footer></footer></p>

<p>Note on high dividend yield: the highest yielding quintile is
not the highest returning one, the second highest yielding quintile is.
Appreciation isn't too great for highest yielding quintile, being
beaten by the market. [Actually, I, Mark Carter, have a theory on this:
maybe the ultra-high yielders contain a significant proportion of
stocks that are about to reduce or cut their dividends. In this case,
there would be a significant amount of underperformers].</p>

<p><footer><b>Low Price to Cash Flow</b> :
sorry, didn't find data</footer></p>

<p><footer><b>Low Price To Book</b> : similar
results as Low P/E</footer></p>

<p><footer>Dividend yield doesn't work as well as PER, PCR
and PBR ... a result not inharmonious with O'Shaughnessey's work. There
is a plus for the dividend strategy though, in bear markets it was the
strategy that lost the least. It is good for very defensive investors
who are afraid of losing a lot when markets go south.</footer></p>

<h3><footer>Stock selection </footer></h3>

<ul>

  <li>Invest equally in 20 to 30 stocks, diversified among 15 or
more industries (if your assets are of sufficient size).</li>

  <li>Buy medium- or large sized stocks<footer>. Dreman
studied only large companies and can't guarantee that the methods work
on small ones (according to O'Shaughnessey, they don't as a matter of
fact). Dreman prefers big companies because they are easier to trade,
are under more scrutiny and less likely to manipulate their earnings
with creative accounting and also because of their visibility usually
attract the market's attention when they turn around much more quickly
than a really anonymous stock.</footer></li>

</ul>

<p>Five indicators which he looks for in a purchase:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A strong financial position</li>

  <li>As many favourable operating and financial ratios as
possible - Return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), profit
margins, low expenses. All that stuff.</li>

  <li>A higher rate of earnings growth than the S&amp;P500 in
the immediate past, and the likelihood that it will not plummet in the
near future. After some harsh experiences, Dreman learned to keep an
eye out for companies that still have a long way to fall. He does look
at Wall Street forecasts to a certain extent, to see if forecasts show
huge continued losses. It is often the case that a stock will not pick
up straight away when it appears the worst is really over, so there are
still opportunities for contrarians even when they do take advantage of
analysts research.</li>

  <li>Earnings estimates should always lean to the conservative
side</li>

  <li>An above-average dividend yield, which the company can
sustain and increase.</li>

</ul>

<p>Dreman also discovered that you could buy the least expensive
stocks within an industry, as determined by the four contrarian
strategies, regardless of how high or low the general price of the
industry group. Although the strategy marginally underperformed
absolute contrarianism (cheapest stocks in the stock universe, ignoring
any deliberate attempt to diversify or impose restraints on investment
in any given sector), it does have the important psychological
advantage that it will necessarily get you a few stocks in "hot
sectors" so you won't feel left out and periods of underperformance,
which do occur in contrarianism often enough to shake off a few
disbelievers and fling them into growth investing, will be less severe.
Dreman's tests also found that the contrarian strategy within
industries performed well in bear markets, losing less than the market
averages when markets fell. As before, the best bearish defense seems
to be the high dividend yield strategy.</p>

<p>Sell a stock when its PER (or other contrarian indicator)
approaches that of the overall market, regardless of how favourable
prospects may appear. Replace it with another contrarian stock. Too
many managers take the "round trip" of holding a stock all the way up
and holding it all the way down again. Also sell it if the stock
appears to have a deteriorating outlook. Don't hold bad stocks just
because you are a contrarianism, you are looking for major declines in
the company's fundamental ability to make money. Sell them and be
ruthless. The idea of contrarianism is to buy undervalued stocks, not
bad stocks.</p>

<p>Dreman suggests you give a company 2.5 or 3 years to work out.
John Templeton, another one of the great masters of value investing
gave a stock six years.</p>

<h3>Fundamental changes</h3>

<p>Dreman investigated cash flow growth, sales growth, earnings
growth, return on equity and profit margin for a "value group", "growth
group", and the market average. He found that there was good positive
correlation between what had happened in the previous 5 years with what
happened over the subsequent five years. In other words, the growth
stocks that were awarded high multiples in the first place continued to
be highly successful growth stocks after the purchase as well. All of
the numbers are favourable for the growth stocks throughout, they
continued to be superior to the market - and yet they underperformed.
Yet the contrarian stocks remained lousy companies, their growth and
return on equity was still below the market averages after the
purchase, and yet they outperformed. Growth stocks hardly respond to
good news as they are already priced to take good news into account,
the only thing that affects them is bad news. The converse applies to
dogs. This also shows that analysts are reasonably good at spotting
growth stocks, the problem lies in them being ridiculously overpriced
and having expectations that are often unachievable.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ben Graham said in <i>Security
Analysis</i>: "Extremely few companies have been able to show a
high rate of uninterrupted growth for long periods of time. Remarkably
few also of the large companies suffer ultimate extinction. For most,
this history is one of vicissitudes, of ups and downs, with changes in
their relative standing."</p>

<h3>Crisis investing</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Political and financial crises lead investors to sell
stocks. This is precisely the wrong reaction. Buy during a panic, don't
sell.</li>

  <li>In a crisis, carefully analyse the reasons put forward to
support lower stock prices - more often than not they will disintegrate
under scrutiny.</li>

  <li>Diversify extensively. No matter how cheap a group of
stocks looks, you never know for sure that you aren't getting a clinker.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Small cap stocks</h3>

<p>Dreman does find that small companies do better than really
large ones, he cautions that survival rates are lower and transaction
costs are higher. Liquidity is always bad for small stocks, and you
only need a bigger spread of a couple of percent to completely offset
the much higher theoretical profits of small companies. Dreman
recommends people stick to larger companies, but nevertheless includes
five more rules for small-cap contrarian investment strategy.</p>

<ul>

  <li>Buy companies that are strong financially (normally no more
than 60% debt in the capital structure for a manufacturing firm). </li>

  <li> Buy companies with increasing and well protected dividends
that also provide above-market yield.</li>

  <li> Pick companies with above-average earnings growth rates. </li>

  <li> Diversify widely, particularly in small companies, because
these issues have far less liquidity. A good portfolio should contain
about twice as many stocks as an equivalent large-cap one.</li>

  <li> Be patient. Nothing works every year, but when smaller
caps click, returns are often tremendous. </li>

</ul>

<p>Dreman repeated the tests with price-to-cash flow,
price-to-book value and dividends and found that the effect worked well
in each, though was less successful for high yielding small-cap stocks.</p>
