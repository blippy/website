<h1> Dorfman stock filters</h1>


<hr><h2>Bunny portfolio </h2>
<p>The name of this portfolio is based on the Energiser Bunny - a mascot which 
  keeps on going long after people expect it to. </p>
Buy Criteria:

<li>Select stocks that have shown at least 25% average annual growth over the 
  previous 5 years</li>
<li> Remove any selling at over 12 times earnings</li>
<li> Select 5 with the fastest historical earnings growth, and 5 with the lowest 
  PEs</li>





<hr><h2>Long haul</h2>

This is an investment strategy for people looking to buy stocks for the long-term. He doesn't
recommend buying shares and forgetting about them, even though the
results are sometimes pleasant. Still, I get occasional requests from
readers for a list of stocks you can buy and leave alone for 10 years. To put this list together, I started with candidates meeting the following criteria:
<li> Market value of $2 billion or more;
<li> Return on equity (a measure of profitability) of at least 15 percent in the latest fiscal year;
<li> Debt that is less than 50 percent of stockholders' equity (except for financial companies);
<li> A stock price that is less than 15 times earnings.
<p>
From a few dozen candidates, he uses
judgment to pick my 10 stocks. Strike a balance among
industries, and between large companies and medium-sized ones.





<hr><h2>Old Faithful</h2>
<p>This portfolio was formerly known as his &quot;Gold Standard&quot; but he changed 
  the name so as not to confuse people into thinking that the portfolio was actually 
  related to gold or currencies. The portfolio is one of his favourite ones, along 
  with Robot and Bunny.</p>
<p>The selection criteria have evolved a bit over the past seven years but haven't 
  really changed much. They are:</p>

  <li> For value, a stock price less than 15 times earnings and 2 times revenue.</li>
  <li> For profitability, a return on equity of at least 15 percent.</li>
  <li> For financial strength, debt less than 50 percent of stockholders' equity.</li>
  <li> For growth, earnings increases averaging at least 15 percent for the past 
    five years.</li>
  <li> For ease of trading, a market value of at least $250 million. </li>

<p>Dorfman appears not to advocate buying all the stocks that appear on the list, 
  but to buy a subset of 5 to 10 of them. The subset would appear to be chosen 
  by personal preference.</p>


<hr><h2> Perfect 10 portfolio </h2>
<p>I think it gets its name from the 1970's film "10", starring diddy Dudley Moore, 
  and Bo Derek. </p>
Buy Criteria:

<li> Select from stocks with a PE of 10 - Judgement is allowed </li>

<p>The portfolio is up 16% from July 2002, trailing the S&P 500 by about 9% </p>





<hr><h2>Robot portfolio</h2>
Buy Criteria:

<li> select stocks worth at least $500m (there are about 1800 in the US). In 
  the UK, I suggest using the FTSE350 as a substitute</li>
<li>eliminate those companies with debt greater than equity, or negative earnings 
</li>
<li> pick the 10 stocks with the lowest PEs for the last 4 quarters </li>



<hr>

<hr><h2>Sell Criteria</h2>
Usual sell criteria is that investments are sold after one year, and the process is repeated.
