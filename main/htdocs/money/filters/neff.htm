<h1>Neff stock filter</h1>



This filter was devised by John Neff - a value investor for the Windsor
fund. I don't think he runs his filter mechanically, so the results 
of the filter should probably considered as interesting tips rather
than a strategy to follow blindly.

<h2>Buy Criteria</h2>


Neff is interested in companies where:
<pre>
          (total return)/ PE > 2
</pre>
where he defines
<pre>
          total return = sustainable earnings growth rate + dividend yield
</pre>

He further states that a reasonable and sustainable earnings growth
rate between 7% and 20% usually caught investors' attention. He is
suspicious of growth rates above 20%, which he claims involves
too much risk.


<h2>Sell Criteria</h2>

Unknown - but presumably shares are to be sold when they no longer
meet value criteria.

<h2>Source</h2>

Found on a page at The Motley Fool. I think the information is derived from "John 
Neff on Investing" by John Neff and Steven Mintz.
