<h2>James O'Shaughnessey</h2>

<p>In very brief form, this is what O'Shaughnessy found: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Small capitalisation strategies owe their superior returns
to microcap stocks with market capitalisation below $25 million. These
stocks are too small for virtually any investor to buy. </li>

  <li>Buying stocks with low PERs is most profitable when you
stick to larger, better known issues. </li>

  <li>Price-to-Sales ratio is the best value ratio to use for
buying market-beating stocks. </li>

  <li>Last year's biggest losers are the worst stocks to buy this
year. </li>

  <li>Last year's earnings gains alone are worthless in
determining what the stock will do this year. </li>

  <li>Using several factors dramatically improves investment
performance. </li>

  <li>You can beat the S&amp;P 500 by four times if you
concentrate on large, well-known stocks with high dividend yields. </li>

  <li>Relative strength is the only growth variable that
consistently beats the market. </li>

  <li>Buying the most popular issues with the highest PERs is one
of the worst approaches. </li>

  <li>Risk is one of the most important elements to consider in a
strategy. </li>

  <li>Combining growth and value strategies is the best way to
improve your investment performance.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Testing strategies</h3>

<h4>Low PERs </h4>

<p>Comparing the effect of PER on subsequent appreciation, the
author found that there was a big difference between the behaviour of
big stocks and small stocks. The "large" portfolio quite strongly
reacted to a low PER, buying a large stock with a low PER was a good
way to improve on index averages. The tendency was somewhat different
with smaller stocks though, in fact the low PER stocks in the "all
stocks" portfolio underperformed their average. It seems that for small
stocks, a low PER is not necessarily a good thing. In addition, the
volatility of low PER small stocks was greater than the average for
small stocks.</p>

<p>The very bottom decile of PERs, the 10% of stocks with the
lowest PERs was not as good as the next 40%. Perhaps these stocks truly
are the losers that deserve a low PER. The best range of PERs for "all
stocks" were those stocks in the second, third and fourth deciles.
Avoid the top 50% of PERs, and the bottom 10%. The best was the stocks
in the 10%-20% range. For large stocks the bottom three deciles were
the best.</p>

<h4>Low PBRs (Price-to-Book Ratios)</h4>

<p>Over the long term, buying stocks with the lowest price to
book ratios pays off very well compared to the market average (more
than double), both in the "large stocks" universe and with "all
stocks". Volatility was higher, which in risk adjusted terms made the
strategy less desirable for small stocks compared with large. There
were long periods though, spanning decades, where high PBR stocks
actually outperformed their indexes. This is one strategy that you
don't want to be trying to use based on recent history, it flips to the
opposite trend frequently, but in an unpredictable manner.</p>

<p>Ranking deciles, the bottom decile was always the best to
invest in. The strategy leads to a higher volatility of returns for
smaller stocks, but the results are still pleasing. Unfortunately the
strategy is proven wrong for fairly extended periods, where the market
actually rewards a high PBR, however in the longer term low PBR stocks
dominate convincingly.</p>

<h4>Low PCRs (Price-to-Cashflow)</h4>

<p>The market rewarded low PCRs, but such stocks showed a higher
volatility. On a risk adjusted basis possibly the gains were not
worthwhile. Over some short periods, high PCR stocks did very well, but
over the medium term, and especially the long term they were a
disaster. </p>

<h4>Low PSRs (Price-to-Sales Ratios)</h4>

<p>The PSR really is the greatest value indicator, correlations
between a low PSR and high stock gains are unmistakable, with very low
volatility. The indicator works well with large stocks as well, though
the strategy yields its greatest gains with small stocks. High PSR
stocks are toxic to your health, the gains were minimal and volatility
went through the roof. </p>

<p>With each rising decile the PSR hurt performance. There was no
better PSR than the very lowest one, in all cases the lower the PSR the
better. The only time high PSR stocks beat the benchmarks was in the
late 60s, when spellbound growth investors chased after stocks with
stories. These returns were severely reversed in the next decade. Note
that during this time, however, low PSR stocks also did well
(everything did well in the 60s!). </p>

<h4>Dividend yields </h4>

<p>Again in this particular study, utility stocks are excluded,
for they are typically high yield and any survey of high yield stocks
would simply be a survey of utilities. It turns out that the effect of
dividend yield depends very much on the size of the company you buy.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, over the years high yielding stocks have largely
failed to keep up with their benchmarks. Taking the top 50 yielding
stocks from the "all stocks" portfolio resulted in very disappointing
results very much below the "all stocks" return. The top 50 in the
"large stocks" portfolio performed much better, in fact buying high
yielding large stocks gave a return almost double the "large" result,
with virtually identical volatility.</p>

<p>In fact the bar chart on page 155 of dividend yield by decile
vs appreciation in large stocks is not particularly convincing, good
results occur for the higher 40% of yields, but also for the yields in
the 7th and 8th decile (bottom 20 to 40% of yields). </p>

<h4>The 50 stocks with the biggest increase in EPS last year </h4>

<p>Actually, this is like closing the barn door after the horse
has bolted. These stocks, which made such impressive earnings gains
last year, are now likely to be very overpriced, as bullish speculators
rush in to the latest greatest of the growth stocks. It is very hard to
continue very high gains for long, so what usually happens is those
speculators who were seduced by the big win last year end up leaving in
disgust when their overpriced stock fails to continue such a
performance. The strategy did have some good runs, not surprisingly
this included most of the 60s, when speculation did that to all the
growth stocks. The rest of the time it was just high volatility and low
gains. Large stocks did much worse than small stocks in this particular
technique.</p>

<h4>The 50 stocks with the worst earnings changes </h4>

<p>The requirement was that companies still be making money, but
the profit should fall from spectacular to pitiful. The results were
better than buying the best gainers, but volatility was higher than the
index, with lower returns for small stocks. Large stocks did better
than small stocks, marginally beating the large stocks index, but with
higher volatility.</p>

<p>The decile plots were unenlightening. There is no clear
pattern that emerges. Clearly one year gains in EPS are not a
worthwhile parameter to base investment decisions on.</p>

<h4>Five year EPS percentage changes </h4>

<p>Perhaps if you take a five year gain in EPS it would be better
than only one year? Actually, no. The results were pretty similar, top
and bottom 50 stock portfolios underperformed the averages, decile
plots showed that for "all stocks" you can do marginally better
sticking to just above the median EPS percentage change, but the "large
stocks" portfolio was pretty flat, though it might be an idea to avoid
the highest decile. The conclusion from EPS studies is that investors
pay too much for stocks with great EPS gains, both one year and five
year averages. Forget about using EPS gains as a research method,
except to avoid extremes.</p>

<h4>Profit margins by decile </h4>

<p>The results were quite unexpected. A look at the results by
deciles shows that apart from the 10% of stocks with the very lowest
profit margins, the stocks that did best were the ones in the lower
profit margin end of the scale, quite distinctly so for both large and
small stocks. The implications are that you should avoid stocks with
the highest profit margins, if you wish to use this method as a
determinant.</p>

<h4>Return on Equity </h4>

<p>High ROE is the hallmark of a growth stock. You calculate it
by dividing common stock equity into income before extraordinary items
then multiply by 100 to get a percentage. This is another factor people
believe will provide a good gauge of how well the company invests
shareholder's money, so presumably it means they should manage your
money well too.</p>

<p>The second and third deciles seem to be the best (i.e. at the
highr ROE end), but the strategy lacks consistency.</p>

<h4>Relative Price Strength (momentum)</h4>

<p>The decile chart of both "all stocks" and "large stocks"
clearly slopes quite evenly, returns declining linearly as last year's
momentum drops, though the lowest decile lies well below the trend
line. For large stocks the line wasn't as neat, the 8th percentile
actually did better than the "large" portfolio (though not as well as
the highest momentum). Past the 8th percentile returns dropped again,
the 9th and 10th percentiles being pretty bad.</p>

<h4>Adding value factors to improve performance of RPS</h4>

<p>The last third of the book deals with combining factors to
improve performance. By using a few factors you can greatly enhance
returns, or diminish volatility, depending on your goals. </p>

<p>The author goes on at length about the various combinations
your can use. I think it's a bit too much to present here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Cornerstone Value Strategy</b></p>

<p></p>

<p> This is a blue-chip strategy. It uses "leading" stocks. These
stocks, as defined in this book: 1) come from the "large" stocks
universe, 2) have more common shares outstanding than the average stock
in the Compustat database, 3) have cashflows per share exceeding the
Compustat mean 4) have sales 1.5 times (or better) the Compustat mean
5) they aren't utility stocks.</p>

<p> This definition excluded all but 570 of the 9889 stocks in
Compustat, only 6% of the whole.</p>

<p> Low PERs are a good thing with leaders, returns were superior
to the "leader" index.</p>

<p> High yield worked very well with leaders. Buying the leading
stocks with the highest dividend yields did four times better than the
"large stocks" index, returning $6.4 million. Volatility was very good,
a standard deviation of 16.95%, only very slightly above the "large
stocks" volatility of 16.01%.</p>

<p> Downside protection was very good, the largest fall this
strategy ever experienced was a 15% drop in one year. Over 5 year
periods it never lost money. This is extraordinary!</p>

<p> Not only is the strategy fantastic in bear markets, it also
shines on bulls. It did extremely well in bull markets, nicely beating
the "large" index.</p>

<p> This strategy not only had good returns, but it is one of the
simplest to implement. Paraphrased, it means you should buy a portfolio
of blue chip stocks with the highest yields. That's all there is to it.</p>

<p> <b>The Cornerstone Growth Strategy</b>
</p>

<p> Looking for a growth strategy that would complement the
cornerstone value strategy, O'Shaughnessy developed this one. Tests of
combinations of variables failed to turn up anything worthwhile using
5-year compound earnings growth rates and profit margins as factors.
Uniting increased earnings with low price-to-sales ratios gives a
strategy that performs virtually the same as low PSR alone, though with
lower volatility. <b>This strategy involves buying stocks from
the "all stocks" universe, insisting on EPS being higher than the
previous year and having a PSR below 1.5 and buying the 50 stocks from
that list with the highest one-year previous performance. </b>The
increase of PSR to 1.5 is to make the strategy less rigorous, allowing
more stocks to be included in the rankings of top growth.</p>

<p>
Returns are approximately equal to the PSR&lt;=1, top 50 growth
strategy, but with very slightly lower volatility, and better base
rates (this means it works more consistently, making money more often
than the simpler method).</p>

<p>Growth strategies work better with small stocks. The returns
on
growth-type strategies were always superior using the "all" stocks
universe, they simply didn't pay very well on large stocks.</p>

<p>This strategy is the one to use for those with a slightly
higher risk
tolerance than one who would use the Cornerstone Value Strategy. The
higher volatility of the growth version is very well compensated for by
the extra gains. What is so great about it is that it includes value
and growth filters in one. It gets you in on popular, fast moving
growth issues, but the PSR filter keeps you out of anything overpriced.
The common feature of every one of the top growth strategies found in
this book is that some sort of value factor was used.</p>

<p><b>Optimal strategies that achieve the highest gains
with lowest volatility</b></p>

<p>A reminder of what is termed the Sharpe Ratio. The Sharpe
Ratio is used
in risk analysis to rank strategies. The highest Sharpe Ratios are the
best. The way to calculate them is to take the average return from the
strategy, subtract the risk-free rate of interest (90 day T-bills rate)
and divide by the standard deviation of returns. To get a really high
Sharpe Ratio you need high returns and low volatility.</p>

<p>By using a 50-50 approach, allocating half the portfolio to
the
Cornerstone Growth strategy and half to the Cornerstone Value strategy,
the results were only marginally inferior to the results of the
Cornerstone Growth strategy, but with a similar volatility to the "all
stocks" index, only 19.99%, compared to "all stocks" 19.70%. This is
extraordinary, accounting for an exceptional Sharpe Ratio of 68,
one of the highest found.</p>

<p>This combined strategy blows previous ideas about efficient
frontiers
out of the water. For the same volatility as the market, you can design
a portfolio with gains vastly superior to the market index.</p>

<p>The author recommends this strategy for all investors except
those very
near to retirement. Those who are approaching retirement can reduce
their growth portfolio and increase the value portion to make the
returns even more secure.</p>

<p>The figures tell the whole story, the first is the return, the
numbers
in the brackets are the standard deviation of return (volatility) and
the Sharpe Ratio. Over the period tested (Dec 31 1952 - Dec 31 1996),
"large stocks" (read: S&amp;P 500) grew a compound 13.19% (16.18%,
45)
a year. The Cornerstone Value approach returned 16.73% (17.14%, 64),
the Cornerstone Growth strategy gave 21.72% (25.59%, 63) and the United
Strategy gave 19.23% (19.99%, 68).</p>

<p></p>

<h3>Sharpe Ratio</h3>

<p>Sharpe ratio = (avg return - risk free interest)/volatility</p>

<p>The Sharpe Ratio is used in risk analysis to rank strategies.
The highest Sharpe Ratios are the best. The way to calculate them is to
take the average return from the strategy, subtract the risk-free rate
of interest (90 day T-bills rate) and divide by the standard deviation
of returns. To get a really high Sharpe Ratio you need high returns and
low volatility.</p>

<h3>Top Strategies by absolute return </h3>

<p>The book actually rates almost 70 different systems, I'll put
the top 15 here. The $10,000 becomes figures are a bit different to
those quoted above because some of the ranked strategies used five
years of previous EPS data. Because of that all strategies start
running on Dec 31, 1954 instead of 1951. </p>

<p>The investment strategy used was to update the portfolio every
12 months with the stocks that best reflect the trading style. Taxes
and dealing costs are ignored. Prices used are "at market" averages for
the day of purchase and all methods were applied mechanically by the
computer based on publicly knowable data that was as much as 12 months
old. Dividends were not reinvested, merely added to capital returns. </p>

<p>The only question is, can you depend on the next 50 years to
behave very much in the same way as the last 50? I look forward to
reading the 2050 edition to find out! If these techniques should fail,
then it should mean there will be something very wrong with the idea of
buying high flying stocks that are still quite cheap. Somehow this
scenario doesn't seem so likely, as long as the herd wants to try to
beat the system, buying glamour stocks and following up all the gossip,
such techniques will remain underutilised, and hence will work. </p>

<p>So, all-in-all, the strategy favoured by <a href="http://www.winninginvesting.com">www.winninginvesting.com</a>
is the Cornerstone Growth strategy. This strategy involves buying
stocks from the "all stocks" universe, insisting on EPS being higher
than the previous year and having a PSR below 1.5 and buying the 50
stocks from that list with the highest one-year previous performance. </p>

<p>On a personal note, I think that that if you want to buy less
than 50 stocks, then maybe you could require analysts projected
earnings be greater than the current year.</p>

<hr>
<h2>The perils of back-testing</h2>

<p>So, the section above was the good news. Now for the bad news.</p>

<p>Data mining: sifting through a series of chance results, and
picking out the associations with the happiest outcomes. Statisticians
will dismiss your analysis as the inevitable outcome of in-sample
analysis. In other words, you have found associations peculiar to the
limited amount of data available to you. The cure? An out-of-sample
study. If you intentionally search for associations with stock market
returns, you will come up with some pretty amazing specimens. Perhaps
the best known is the "Super Bowl" strategy--stocks lead the year after
a team from the old NFL wins the game, while T-bills win out when an
old AFL team prevails. </p>

<p>Which gets us to The Motley Fool. This wildly popular website
offers several easy recipes for beating the market. Perhaps the most
famous is the Foolish Four:</p>

<p>1) Start with the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.<br>

2) Pick the 5 with the lowest share prices.<br>

3) Drop the lowest-priced stock.<br>

4) Double up on the second lowest-priced stock.</p>

<p>Step 1, of course, is the venerable Dogs of the Dow. But Steps
2 through 4 are head-scratchers. Why should the share price of a stock
have anything to do with its return? And why should there be such a
large discrepancy between the returns of the Dogs with the lowest and
second-lowest share price? These make about as much sense as summer
bowling night lottery purchases.</p>

<p>Enter Gary Karz, who runs the Investorhome website and knows
data mining when he sees it. With a bit of digging, Mr. Karz actually
found seven Foolish portfolios. Two had outperformed the market, two
had underperformed it, and most ominously, two had been closed.</p>

<p>Karz contacted academicians Grant McQueen and Steven Thorley,
who had previously examined the Dow Dividend strategy. (Bottom line: It
beats the market by a hair, but only before taxes.) The result, "Mining
Fool's Gold," is a scholarly examination of the Foolish Four strategy,
published in Financial Analysts Journal, as well as online. It's first
and foremost a lucid and funny primer for small investors on the
dangers of data mining, and how to spot it. Among the warning signs:</p>

<p>1) The presence of multiple strategies, some of which are
dropped.<br>

2) Strategies that make little theoretical sense, like the Superbowl
method, or one using raw share-price data.<br>

3) Overly complex trading rules.</p>

<p>The authors find the Foolish Four guilty on all counts. Yes,
it beats the Dow by 2.95% annually for the July 1973-June 1996 period.
But apply the acid test--an "out-of-sample" analysis using a 1949-72
test period--and it wins by only 0.32%. And with 40% more risk. It
actually underperforms the simple Dogs strategy for 1949-72.</p>

<p>The Fools are not alone. James O'Shaughnessy, author of the
wildly popular How to Retire Rich, and What Works on Wall Street,
similarly mined stock selection strategies over the past 50 years and
came up with a number of sure-fire methods, ranging from a simple
Dog-like portfolio to more complex strategies. Following publication,
the author started several funds based on his methods. Thus far, the
out-of-sample results have not been encouraging. Since their inception
in late 1996, only one of his four funds--O'Shaughnessy Cornerstone
Growth OSCGX-- has beaten its peers or the appropriate Barra Index.
O'Shaughnessy will certainly retire rich, but his shareholders may not.
(And really, 1.46% in expenses for a Dogs-of-the-Dow OSDGX fund? Gimme
a break.)</p>

<p>Even the most respected academicians cannot occasionally avoid
temptation. Wharton's Jeremy Siegel, in (Stocks for the Long Run),
famously points out that if you ignore 1975-83, small-cap stocks don't
outperform. Well, yes. Make me 25 years younger and 40% faster and I
can play cornerback for the Broncos. C'mon, Jeremy, real academicians
don't vaporize whole decades.</p>

<p>So next time somebody offers you a convoluted market-beating
strategy based on historical returns, hide your wallet.</p>
