24-Nov-2010 Current selection criteria favours MFI (Magic Formula 2) <a href="http://alt-mcarter.blogspot.com/2010/11/share-selection-criteria.html">link</a>

<hr><h2>Filters devised by me</h2>

<p>07-May-2015 Yield &ge; 3%, NetDebt/Mkt cap < 0 (i.e. has net cash). Additionally, look for non-cyclicity and high ROCE, or something owned by Woodford. Maybe substitute 3% for 1.1X, or 1.5X market yield. The point is to generate good dividend payers that will grow. It's better to have a mid-cap than a Footsie company. Also maybe look at past growth rate in divvies over 4/5 years to see what the annual growth rate was.

<p>19-Nov-2014 Dividend streaks of at least 8, ROCE 5 high, and low gearing. Reasonable PE. This should catch "Terry Smith/Warren Buffett" type quality shares

<p>19-Nov-2014 Stocks that show a high Stockopedia Momentum Rank, but poor performance relative to the market over 5 years. Ignore Quality and Value. This should catch shares in turnaround.


<p>07-Nov-2014 Combine EY with RS6m as per <a href="http://www.quant-investing.com/strategies/PI6m-EY">Quant Investing</a>.

<p>23-Jul-2014 Just use Stockopedia's <a href="http://www.stockopedia.com/screens/piotroski-f-score-price-to-earnings-value-screen-36">Piotroski F-Score Price to Earnings Value Screen</a>, maybe add an RSI &lt; 30.

<p>
21-May-2014 Look for good quality, cheap companies that are currently oversold and due for a rebound. Methodology: Stockopedia QV &ge; 95, and RSI &lt; 30.


<p>
07-May-2014 Look for PBV &le; 20th percentile. Look for high uncertainty, as measured by, say, either high standard deviation in valuation models presented on Stockopedia, or high standard deviation in PBV (or its reciprocal) over the last 5 years. This is an alternative to Piotroski, and is based on the idea that it is usually the outliers that win big. So, instead of looking for certainty, we actively look for uncertainty, and hope to benefit from anti-fragility. This should be especially effective when the VIX is high.

<p>
10-Feb-2014 RS6m in highest-quintile, PEG &lt; 0.8. Ref DB04/283. It
is designed to look for recovery shares. PE is not a problem, because
recovery shares often show high PE.

<p>
08-Jul-2012 Simple idea for selecting a universe of growth shares: PER
&lt; 18, ROE &ge; 15, z-score &ge; 3, Yield_Rolling &gt; 1,
Turnover_Growth_3Yr &ge; 33 (corresponding to 10% pa revenue growth
over 3 years)

<p>
22-Aug-2012 Select reasonably-priced companies with good ROE and dividends at least doubled over last decade: MarketCap &gt; 50, Div_Growth_10Yr &ge; 100, ROE_10Yr &ge; 15, EV_EBITDA &le; 8 . A fair list is presented. Use personal subset like int cover, gearing, z-score, yield and negative RSI, monotonically increasing dividend and EPS, low beta, for example.

<p>
MC03 06-Sep-2012 Based on Ben Graham ideas. EPS at least doubled over a decade. At most two falls in EPS that are &ge; 5%. Rank by EV/EBITDA ascending. Weed out any junk.

<h3>Screening tools</h3>


<li><a href="https://www.halifaxmarketwatch.co.uk/stock_screener.cgi" >Halifax</a> - Simple, quick, and free; but rather limited. Check out the full filter for something a little more sophisticated. 

<li>Interactive Investor - inferior to Halifax

<li><a href="http://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/screener/customScreen.asp" >Investors Chronicle</a> - a good one, allowing you specify many criteria. Maybe it has the same engine as the Financial Times screener??

<li>MSN Stock Screener - possibly the most useless stock screener imaginable

<li><a href="http://www.stockscreen123.com/app/opener/community/scr">StockScreen123</a> - it cannot be used to screen for UK stocks, but it lists many pre-defined screens (Piotroski, Buffett, Graham, Lynch, etc.), their criteria, and their results over a number of periods. The criteria seem to be weighted in some unspecified way, though.

<li>TD Waterhouse - inferior to Halifax

<li>blog.intelligentinvestor.com.au (defunct) wrote: My ideal opportunity is typically a cyclical stock that's down more than 80% from its high, which is trading on four times peak earnings and where there's some director buying. My best stock picks have typically come from this category. Added 05-May-2015

<li><a href="http://boards.fool.co.uk/mc-essex-quotlthypgtit-doesnt-12520886.aspx">F958B</a> - "Method E" gave exceptional outperformance with any portfolio size and any time period. The selection process: Select only the non-cyclicals from the FSTE. Rank by yield. Select the 10 highest yielders. He concluded that non-cyclicals need less portfolio diversification, were more resilient, more predictable, whilst the highest-yielding cyclicals are likely to underperform.

The <a href="http://mcturra2000.wordpress.com/2012/09/29/6-month-checkup-2/">followup</a> seemed pretty good.
