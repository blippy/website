<h1>Graham search criteria</h1>


<hr><h2>Ten attributes of an undervalued stock</h2>

<p>This section is a summary from one of Janet Lowe's books about Ben Graham. Graham 
  wrote the book &quot;Intelligent Investor&quot; - arguably the best book on 
  investment ever written. If you have not yet read it, then you owe it to yourself 
  to read it.</p>
   

<b>Risk measurements:</b>
<ol>
  <li>E/P &gt;= 2 x triple-A bond yield (E/P is the inverse of the P/E ratio).</li>
  <li>P/E &lt;= 0.4 x highest average P/E achieved by the stock in the most recent 
    5 years</li>
  <li>Dividend yield &gt;= 2/3 x triple-A bond yield</li>
  <li>Stock price &lt;= 2/3 x tangible book value per share</li>
  <li>Stock price &lt;= 2/3 x (Current assets - all liabilities)</li>
</ol>
<b>Financial soundness</b>
<ol start="6">
  <li>Total debt &lt; tangible book value</li>
  <li>Current ratio &gt;= 2</li>
</ol>
<b>History of stable earnings</b>
<ol start="8">
  <li>Total debt &lt;= current assets - all liabilities</li>
  <li>Earnings that have doubled in the most recent 10 years</li>
  <li>No more than 2 declines in earnings of 5% or more in the past 10 years</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be noted that very few companies can meet all the criteria.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Professor Oppenheimer studied the returns from 1974 to 1981. He reported:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>By using Graham's criteria 1 and 6 to select securities from the combined 
    NYSE-AMEX universe, an investor could have achieved a mean annual return of 
    38%. Use of criteria 3 and 6, [or] 1, 3 and 6 would have resulted in mean 
    annual returns of 26% and 29% respectively. Although the superior performance 
    ... declined after 1976, it did not disappear. Furthermore, the performance 
    does not appear to be due either to systemmatic risk or to size effects.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The results apply to stocks selected from both the New York and the American 
  Stock Exchange. It was noted that when the test was applied to only the New 
  York Stock Exchange, the results were acceptable, but not impressive. </p>
<p>Readers may also be puzzled (as am I) about how the application of criterion 
  3 reduces the returns from 38% to 29%.<footer></footer></p>

<hr><a name="gr"><h2>Graham Ratio</h2></a>

I have defined it in the glossary as GR=MKT/NCAV. Graham sought companies in which NCAV &gt; 1.5 MKT.

<p><a href="http://www.sharelockholmes.com/%5Cdocs%5CShare-Search.htm">SharelockHolmes</a> provides this statistic as Graham_Rati, and defines it, equivalently, as
<br> Market Capitalisation / [Net Current Assets - Creditors Long - Provisions] 

<p>You might also want to look at my appropriately-tagged <a href="http://alt-mcarter.blogspot.com/search/label/graham%20ratio" >blog articles</a>. My 
<a href="http://alt-mcarter.blogspot.com/2010/11/graham-ratio-definition-and-statistics.html" >article</a> on 14-Nov-2010 puts the P20 (20th percentile) value at 2.9 for companies with MKT over 50M
</p>

<p>
On 12-Feb-2010, Investors Chronicle posted the article 
<a href="http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/InvestmentGuides/Shares/article/20100212/27b65674-0f3f-11df-ba8b-0015171400aa/Bargain-shares-for-2010.jsp" >Bargain shares for 2010</a>. Their compound annual return over ten years was 14.8%, compared with the FTSE-ALL of 0.2%. Their 2010 "bargain ratio" was set at 0.4 rather than 1. It's not entirely clear what their "bargain ratio" means. Presumably they are looking for GR &lt; 2.5 (= 1 / 0.4). Their
<a href="http://www.investorschronicle.co.uk/Features/Shares/article/20100212/4bc75a28-16f5-11df-a7ba-0015171400aa/The-8-bargain-shares-for-2010.jsp">selections</a> have MKT in the 22M  range(very small!) and up. Half of them are on AIM.

<hr><a name="simplest"><h2>Graham's Simplest Way/Graham Gearing</h2>

<h3>SharelockHolmes' comments</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.sharelockholmes.com/%5Cdocs%5CShare-Search.htm">SharelockHolmes</a> defines its statistic Graham_Gearing (which I refer to in my glossary as GG) as: 
<blockquote>100 x (Shareholders Funds-Minorities-Prefs) / (Fixed Assets + Current Assets)</blockquote>, citing the words of Ben Graham: "I favor this simple rule: A company should own at 
least twice what it owes. An easy way to check on that is to look at the ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets,  if the ratio is at least 50%, the company's financial condition can be considered sound." 
</p>

<h3>Stingy Investor's comments</h3>

<p>Stingy Investor published an <a href="http://www.ndir.com/SI/articles/0505.shtml" >article</a> in May 2005 described Graham's basic value screen from 1976 called The Simplest Way To Select Bargain Stocks. They summarised the criteria as:
<ol>
<li>Earnings Yield  > max(10, 2 * AAA corportate bond yield)</li>
<li>total assets / shareholder equity &le; 2</li>
</ol>

<p>
where
<ol>
<li>In (1) above, Earning Yield is defined as 1/PER </li>
<li>In (2) above, Leverage Ratio is defined as total assets / shareholder equity. In our definition, it is 1/GG</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Graham's backtests in 1976 found that it provided a fairly consistent 15% average annual return during the prior 50 years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.ndir.com/SI/articles/0710.shtml" >follow-up</a> by the Stingy investor in Jul 2010, they note:
<blockquote>As it stands, the Simple Way is down 2.0% annually since 2005 and trails the S&P500 ETF which is up 0.2% a year over the same period. </blockquote>
So, clearly not an automatic route to wealth.
<p>

<h3>A restatement of the formulae</h3>

In this section, I am going to restate the formulae above in our usual terminology. Since AAA corporate earnings yields are a bit of a mystery quantity here in the UK, and interest rates are low in any event, I have decided to ignore them as a factor in choosing stocks. This means that the selection criteria are now:
<ol>
<li>PER &lt; 10</li>
<li>GG &ge; 0.5</li>
</ol>
