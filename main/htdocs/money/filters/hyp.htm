<h1>HYP : High-yield Portfolio</h1>



<hr><h2>Buy Criteria</h2>

Rank the FTSE100 or maybe the 350 shares by descending yield then work
your way down, picking a share from each sector. Then do a quick check
on the share to make sure that at least in the very near future the
yield appears sustainable, preferably rising. If so, then go for it.
Ideally you want very low borrowings, high cover and so on but almost
certainly you will have to give up on a lot of that for the sake of
essential sector diversification. This process of using the index
ranked by descending yield automatically finds the largest cap highest
yielders at that time.
