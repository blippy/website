<hr><h2>Leases</h2>

Operating leases can form a big part of the financing of a retailer, which is not shown on the balance sheet. Here's a comment by Steve Baines on how to deal with them:
<blockquote>
A commenters have correctly identified, an operating lease (rent) is a debt-like instrument in that it requires the company to make a regular stream of interest-like payments in order to continue making use of the property. However, unlike debt, there is no repayment required at maturity, though the company will clearly need to enter into a new lease in order to continue operating its business.
<p>
In order to reflect this in the accounts, the most common, simple and straightforward method is to add 8x the annual lease payments to both the asset and liabilities sides of the balance sheet (to represent the use of the property - an asset  and the financing against it - a liability). Financial ratios can then be calculated as before. Also adjusted coverage ratios can be calculated by adding-back annual lease costs to each side of the ratio (eg adj interest cover = (EBITDA + Rents)/(Interest + Rents). Clearly, the effect of this is to substantially increase reported leverage and reduce return on capital employed.
<p>
A more detailed (but complex method) would be to determine the dates each lease fell due and discount them back to present value using a particular interest rate. The sum of these payments provides a estimate of the value of the lease which can then be added to the balance sheet as described above. Clearly, this is much more time-consuming and requires the analyst to choose a suitable discount rate.
<p>
Also, the operating lease payments are typically found within Selling, General & Administrative expenses, not within cost of goods sold as suggested by some commenters.
<p>
In addition, ROE is not impacted at all by adjusting for operating leases. ROE would be the same whether the business used operating leases or took on debt to acquire the property freeholds. However, ROE with operating leases will likely be much higher than if freehold property was purchased using equity.
