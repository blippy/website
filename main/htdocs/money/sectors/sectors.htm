<hr><h2>Martin Whitman</h2>

Marty Whitman has developed his own rules of thumb for calculating his
buying prices for various types of businesses:

<li>    Financial-services companies and depositories: Stated book value.
<li>    Small banks: 80% of book value.
<li>    Mortgage portfolio: Calculate yield to maturity and perform credit analysis.
<li>    Financial-guaranty insurers: Adjusted book value - a publicly disclosed number that is book value plus the equity in the present value of certain future premiums.
<li>    Insurance companies: Adjusted book value.
<li>    Real estate companies: Private appraisal value or market value.
<li>    Real Estate (REITs): Appraisal value or discounted present value of cash flow from operations.
<li>    Broker/dealer and asset managers: Tangible book value plus 2% of AUM.
<li>    Operating companies: 10 times peak earnings or below "net asset value."
<li>    Tech companies: 2 times book value, less than 10 times peak earnings, 2 times revenue and cash larger than the book value of all liabilities.
