<h1>Lisp GUIs</h1>

I'm trying to build up a
picture of the GUI functionality that is available for Lisp. My
emphasis is on free implementations, which will hopefully work on
Windows and Linux.


<hr><h2>Approaches</h2>

GUIs for Lisp tend to follow two basic approaches: <br>
<ul>
  <li>FFI (Foreign Function Interfaces) - they use the FFI facilities
of the Lisp implementation, or some external FFI implementation like
CFFI</li>
  <li>Protocol - usually&nbsp;Lisp starts an external process, which it
talks, in plain-text,&nbsp; to&nbsp;a channel like a pipe, stdio, or
socket port</li>
</ul>

<hr><h2>Links to other sites</h2>


<li><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/graphic-forms/">Graphics-Forms</a> - user interface library for Miscrosoft Windows. Works with Allegro, CLISP, LispWorks, SBCL. Last release was Aug 2007.

<li>The lispbuilder-windows
package is a part of the Common Lisp Application Builder project which
is in turn a part of the umbrella Common Lisp Gardeners project. The
goal is to provide all Microsoft Windows API function, which are
available for C programs when you include the standard windows.h header
file. Works with CLISP at least.<br>


<li><a href="http://www.peter-herth.de/ltk/">LTk - The Lisp
Toolkit</a> - binding for the Tk graphics toolkit. It does not require any Tk
knowledge for its usage. As it is written in pure Lisp, it is highly
portable.
