<h2>Passing pointers to words</h2>

Sometimes you want to pass a pointer of a word. So, instead of doing <span style="font-family: monospace;">1 2 +</span> to put <span style="font-family: monospace;">3 </span>on the
stack, you can do<br>

<pre>1 2 ' + execute<br></pre>

to achieve the same effect. It works in both Reva and Win32forth.<br>



<hr><h2>Create within words</h2>

If you want to create a word, you will typically do something like<br>

<pre>create foo<br></pre>

Unfortunately, this does not in a word definition, as you will get a "foo undefined error". To do it in Reva,
you can either do<br>

<pre>: mycreate " create foo" eval ;<br></pre>

or, as I prefer:<br>

<pre>: mycreate " foo" (create) ;<br><br></pre>

If you want to do it in win32forth, the following would work:<br>

<pre>: mycreate s" create foo" evaluate ; </pre>
