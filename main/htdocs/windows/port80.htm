<h1>Port 80</h1>

Unblocking it for use by Apache or IIS.

<hr><h2>First clues</h2>

Run the command <code>netstat -ano | find ":80"</code> . The last column will tell you the PID of anything that might be running on port 80. You can see what the application is by looking at Windows Task Manager : Processes. Ensure you check the box "Show processes from all users". You can make the PID column viewable by selecting menu item View : Select Columns. If the PID is 4, then you've got additional problems, because you cannot just kill that process.

<hr><h2>SQL</h2>

Go into services, and disable anything to do with SQL. This is a known fix on 16-Jan-2012 for the PID 4 problem.

<hr><h2>http.sys</h2>

it might be that Win 7 is running a service called http.sys . The fix is:
<ol>
<li>Launch RegEdit
<li>Go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP
<li>Add a new DWORD (32-bit) value
<li>Name it 'NoRun' not including the quotes
<li>Double click the new property
<li>In the Value data field type '1' not including quotes and click OK
<li>Re-boot your computer
</ol>
