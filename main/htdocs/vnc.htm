<h1>VNC</h1>

<hr><h2>Arch Linux</h2>

Install tigervnc. Configuration is here (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Vncserver">xlink</a>), but the systemd info seems somewhat flakey.


<p>I have a script called vnc that creates and kills sessions.

<hr><h2>Windows: Client side</h2>

TigerVNC seems better than TightVNC. Remmina looks good as a Linux client, but is not available on Windows.
