<h1>Death note</h1>

Volume 1
<ol>
	<li><b>Rebirth</b>: Light discovers the Death Note</li>
	<li><b>Confrontation</b>: Light kills Lind L Tailor, an imposter of L.</li>
	<li><b>Dealings</b>: L realises that Kira is connected with the police. Light is tailed, and is informed by Ryuk of this fact. Ryuk offers Light the 'Shinigami eyes' in exchange for half his remaining lifespan. This would enable Light to learn the stalker's name, and thereby kill the stalker by having his name written in the Death Note.</li>
	<li><b>Pursuit</b>: Light refuses Ryuk's deal. He tests the rules of the Death Note to learn of its limitations. Light boards a bus, together with his stalker. A criminal hijacks the bus, brandishing his gun. The stalker relveals to Light that his name is Raye Penber, an agent for the FBI. The criminal is manoeuvred into touching a piece of the Death Note. He can see Ryuk, and empties the bullets into Ryuk, to no effect. He flees the bus in terror, and is struck and killed by a passing car.</li>
