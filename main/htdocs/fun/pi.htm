<h1 align="left">Squaring the circle</h1>


<div align="left">
<p>"Squaring the circle" means to a construct a square equal in
area to a given circle. Only a compass and straight lines are allowed.
Although it can be proved that this is impossible, it has not actually
put off people providing "solutions". It is interesting because it
makes you think about the process of thinking itself, and how faulty
logic can come to be regarded as true. I have lifted the text out of <b>The
Joy of Pi</b>. My favourite quote is the first one that is
listed, since it involves the most amount of rubbish.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is utterly impossible for one to accomplish the work in a
physical way; it must be done metaphysically and geometrically, not
mathematically. When approached in this manner the problem it is easy
of solution. It is stated by occultists that the number 12 squares the
circle and it is necessary to take into consideration the process
before we can understand this; when correctly understood we know it to
be perfectly true.</p>

<p>The original conception, its natural harmony, and the result,
to my own mind is a demonstrative truth, which I presume it right to
make known, though perhaps at the hazard of unpleasant if not
uncourteous remarks.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now, being in my 81st year ... I have found time to set my
thinks to work. After three long days I was divinely blessed to
discover the true and ancient value of pi. This is the exact value used
by the Great Creator when he created our earth and its four orbit
cycles. The World's unsolved problem, i.e. the complete interlocking of
a triangle, circle, and square - having equal areas - is in the
construction of this Pyramid. This truly confirms that the Great
Creator used the Pi formula of 3 (7.1)/(50) = 3.1420000. The very fact
that the Great Creator, Archangel Michael, should be sufficient
evidence for our adoption.</p>

would ever convince anyone versed in mathematical and mechanical
science, that a person had squared the circle or discovered perpetual
motion.</p>

<hr>
<p>One nineteenth-century circle squarer, after praising God
repeatedly for choosing him to reveal "this precious mathematical
jewel", goes on to show that an inscribed circle can be broken down
into four congruent triangles, and a circumscribed sqaure is made of
eight. Therefore, he asserts, the area of the circle must be the area
of six triangles.</p>
<hr>
<p>Augustus De Morgan tells us in his Budget of Paradoxes that
the eighteenth-century Frenchman Joseph-Louis Vincerns de Mouleon de
Causans "cut a circular piece of turf, squared it, and deduced original
sin and Trinity. He found out that the circle was equal to the square
in which it is inscribed, and he offered a reward for detection of any
error, and actually deposited 10,000 francs as earnest of 300,000. But
the courts would not allow anyone to recover."</p>
<hr>
<p>Nineteenth-century writer James Smith surely holds the record
for most publications on the topic of circle squaring. However, it
should be noted that he paid for each and every one to be printed.
Curiously, he always argued the same point: that pi is 3 1/8. Augustus
De Morgan once wrote of him, "He is beyond doubt the ablest head at
unreasoning, and the greatest hand at writing it, of all who have tried
in our day to attach their names to error. Common cyclometers sink into
pure orthodoxy by his side. ... We can only say this: he is not mad.
Madmen reason rightly upon wrong premises: Mr. Smith reasons wrongly
upon no premises at all."</p>
