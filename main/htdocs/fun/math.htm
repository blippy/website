<h1>Mathematical Limericks</h1>

The integral of zee-squared dee zee,
<br>

From 1 to the cube root of 3,
<br>

Times the cosine,
<br>

Of 3 pi by 9,
<br>

Is the log of the cube root of e.
<p>Original source unknown. 
</p>

<hr>
<p>A mathematician confided <br>


  That the M"obius band is one-sided <br>


  And you'll get quite a laugh <br>


  If you cut one in half <br>


  'Cause it stays in one piece when divided. 
</p>

<p></p>


<hr>
<p>A mathematician named Klein <br>


  Thought the M"obius band was divine <br>


  Said he: If you glue <br>


  The edges of two <br>


  You'll get a wierd bottles like mine. </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>There was a young fellow named Fisk, <br>


  A swordsman, exceedingly brisk. <br>


  So fast was his action, <br>


  The Lorentz contraction <br>


  Reduced his rapier to a disk. </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>'Tis a favorite project of mine <br>


  A new value of pi to assign. <br>


  I would fix it at 3 <br>


  For it's simpler, you see, <br>


  Than 3 point 1 4 1 5 9 </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>If inside a circle a line <br>


  Hits the center and goes spine to spine <br>


  And the line's length is "d" <br>


  the circumference will be <br>


  d times 3.14159 </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>A challenge for many long ages <br>


  Had baffled the savants and sages. <br>


  Yet at last came the light: <br>


  Seems old Fermat was right-- <br>


  To the margin add 200 pages. </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>If (1+x) (real close to 1) <br>


  Is raised to the power of 1 <br>


  Over x, you will find <br>


  Here's the value defined: <br>


  2.718281... </p>


<hr>
<p>A burleycque dancer, a pip <br>


  Named Virginia, could peel in a zip; <br>


  But she read science fiction <br>


  and died of constriction <br>


  Attempting a Moebius strip. </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>This poem was written by John Saxon (an author of math textbooks). <br>


  ((12 + 144 + 20 + (3 * 4^(1/2))) / 7) + (5 * 11) = 9^2 + 0 </p>


<p>A Dozen, a Gross and a Score, <br>


  plus three times the square root of four, <br>


  divided by seven, <br>


  plus five times eleven, <br>


  equals nine squared and not a bit more. </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>In arctic and tropical climes, <br>


  the integers, addition, and times, <br>


  taken (mod p) will yield <br>


  a full finite field, <br>


  as p ranges over the primes. </p>


<p></p>


<hr>
<p>A graduate student from Trinity <br>


  Computed the cube of infinity; <br>


  But it gave him the fidgets <br>


  To write down all those digits, <br>


  So he dropped math and took up divinity. </p>


<hr>
<p>A conjecture both deep and profound <br>


  Is whether the circle is round; <br>


  In a paper by Erdo"s, <br>


  written in Kurdish, <br>


  A counterexample is found. </p>


<p>(Note: Erdo"s is pronounced "Air - dish") </p>


<hr>
Three jolly sailors from Blaydon-on-Tyne,<br>


They went to sea in a bottle by Klein,<br>


Since the sea was inside the hull,<br>


The scenery seen was exceedingly dull. 
<p> I got this one from a book - whose name I forget. Also, it's not really a 
  limerick - but it's close enough.</p>



<hr>
<p>Here's an original by Chris Boyd, who sent it to me via email on 10-Feb-2006. Thanks Chris! Here it is:</p>
<p>4 + (6! - 0.5(12^2 + (403 + 1))) = 2(15^2)<br>
<br>
Four plus the difference between<br>
The factorial of six and the mean<br>
Of twelve squared and four<br>

Hundred three (plus one more)<br>
Equals double the square of fifteen.</p>

<hr><h2>Mathematical Humour</h2>


<p>Classification of mathematical problems as linear and nonlinear is like classification 
  of the Universe as bananas and non-bananas. </p>


<p>A law of conservation of difficulties: there is no easy way to prove a deep 
  result. </p>


<p>"This is a one line proof...if we start sufficiently far to the left."   <br>


</p>


<p> "The problems for the exam will be similar to the discussed in the class. 
  Of course, the numbers will be different. But not all of them. Pi will still 
  be 3.14159... " </p>


<p><br>


  Interesting Theorem: <br>


  All positive integers are interesting. <br>


  Proof: <br>


  Assume the contrary. Then there is a lowest non-interesting positive integer. 
  But, hey, that's pretty interesting! A contradiction. </p>
