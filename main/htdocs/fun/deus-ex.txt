WEAPONS
=======

Meaning of abbreviations:
W - Width (number of cells across in inventory)
H - Height (number of cells high in inventory)
DMG - Base damage
CLIP - clip size
ACC - Base accuracy
AMM - Ammo (single shot only implies it is used once, and is then disgarded)
RNG - Accuracy range
MAX - Maximum range

Assualt rifle

Hasta la vista, baby!

Light Anti-tank Weapon (LAW)

Mini-crossbow
W: 1 H: 1 DMG: 25 CLIP: 4 ACC: 60% AMM: darts
I found this difficult to use. Ammo is plentiful. It takes a while to work,
but will bring down most things. Use it when you are protected from enemy
attack.

Pistol
W: 1 H: 1 DMG: 14 CLIP: 6 ACC: 65% AMM: 10mm
Ammo is plentiful, and is a useful weapon to have even later in the game.
Useful at close quarters when the enemy is dancing around a lot. A single
headshot finishes them.
