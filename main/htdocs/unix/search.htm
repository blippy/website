<h1>Search</h1>

Search facilities on Unix, esp. Debian.


<hr><h2>Catfish</h2>

Installable via Debian. Accessable via menu Accessories:Catfish. Only searches based on filename, not contents. GUI, not command-line (although it does have options when involed from command-line.

<hr><h2>Recoll</h2>

Looks very promising from first impressions. It works via a gui rather than command line. It is more for your personal data. It doesn't follow symbolic links by defaults, and it indexes some directories that you probably aren't interested in - but this is easily changed. Run it by typing <code>recoll</code>. The index must be regenerated using <code>recollindex</code>- which doesn't take too long after an initial scan. I added the following line to my personal crontab:
<pre>     0 2  * * *   recollindex</pre>

Recoll can be started from menu item Accessories:Recoll.

<hr><h2>Also-rans</h2>

A list of programs I have tried, but didn't like much

<li><a href="http://www.debianadmin.com/desktop-search-engine-with-doodle.html">doodle</a> - a desktop search engine, but it only seems to index meta-data. Apparently it is possible to perform full-text indexing, but that may require libextractor plugins. Also comes with a daemon. It seems easier just to use <code>recoll</code>
