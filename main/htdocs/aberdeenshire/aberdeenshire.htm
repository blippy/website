<h3>Blood</h3>

From Feb 2012, donations can be made a max of 4 times in 12 months in intervals of not less than 12 weeks. On 16-Dec-2013, talking to the donor line revealed that I was unlikely to have had a blood transfusion during my mid-2000's operation, which was classified as minor, and hence there is no problem with me giving blood.
