<h1>Thimbl</h1>

Thimbl is a free, open source and distributed micro-blogging project which you host at your own site. It uses the <code>finger</code> daemon to achieve this.



<hr><h2>A technical overview of thimbl</h2>

<pre>
Q: What is thimbl?

A: Think of thimbl as a free Twitter. It is P2P (peer-to-peer) - meaning that it is a network of peers, rather than a centralised service like Twitter. It is a set of "conventions" supported by
some tools. The tools aren't necessary (except for finger) for thimbl to work  
- they just add convenience.

Q: Finger, what's that all about?

A: Finger is a daemon, like a web server. A web server serves HTML pages, 
whilst fingerd - the finger daemon - serves information about the users on a 
system. 

Q: Do I need to set up the finger daemon in order to create blogs?

A: Yes. Without an active finger daemon, there is no way others can see your 
blogs.

Q: Do I need to set up the finger daemon in order to read blogs?

A: No. All Operating Systems have finger (well, strictly speaking not ALL
of them, but certainly Windows, Linux, UNIX and UNIX-like systems has finger
on them). Finger is the base minimum you need to follow someone's blog.     

Q: Is it possible to register into thimbl yet?

A: It is not necessary to register - there is no registration process.
