<h1>Thimbl-CLI</h1>

A command-line interface for Thimbl.

<hr><h2>Prerequisites, downloading, installing, and configuring</h2>

Prerequisites:
<li>Python programming language installed</li>
<li>UNIX-like Operating System. Linux would be ideal, of course, but it will probably also work on Cygwin.</li>
<li>Git installed.</li>

<p>Downloading: <code>git clone https://github.com/blippy/Thimbl-CLI.git</code></p>

<p>Installing: No installation required, just <code>cd Thimbl-CLI</code> and use from there. Ensure that <code>.</code> is in your path</p>

<p>Configuring: <code>Thimbl-CLI</code> needs to be set up for first use. Issue the command:
<pre>thimbl setup ADDRESS BIO NAME WEBSITE MOBILE EMAIL</pre>
Each of the parameters are strings, and have the following meanings:
<li>ADDRESS: Username and domain for the machine where you have installed Thimbl-CLI, of the form luser@example.com . This is an important field that you must supply.</li>
<li>BIO: A brief autobiography, e.g. "Cool cat"</li>
<li>NAME: Your real name</li>
<li>WEBSITE: Your website URL</li>
<li>MOBILE: Your mobile number</li>
<li>EMAIL: contact email address</li>
You MUST supply the ADDRESS field. The other fields are "mandatory", in the sense that you have to supply something, 
but there's nothing to stop you from filling them with blanks like so: "". Strings separated with spaces must be put in quotes, too. 
Here's an example setup:
<pre>thimbl setup luser@example.com   "Champagne socialist"   "Justin Case"   www.foo.bar.com "" luser@bar.com</pre>
Note that in the example I have used a blank for the mobile phone number, as I don't want other knowing my mobile. Notice, too, how ADDRESS, WEBSITE and EMAIL need bar little relation to each other.
 
<hr><h2>Usage</h2>

Apart from <code>setup</code> has the following commands and arguments:
<li><code>fetch</code> - retrieve the plans for each person you are following</li>
<li><code>follow NICK ADDRESS</code> - follow someone using a nickname of NICK, and address of ADDRESS. 
NICK isn't really an important field, but their ADDRESS must be in the form specified above</li>
<li><code>post MSG</code> - post a message</li>
<li><code>print</code> -  print the messages of both yourself and the people you follow</li>

<p>Here's an example session:
<pre>
thimbl post "First post"
thimbl post "Thimbl rocks"
thimbl follow "dk" "dk@telekommunisten.net"
thimbl fetch
thimbl print
</pre>
